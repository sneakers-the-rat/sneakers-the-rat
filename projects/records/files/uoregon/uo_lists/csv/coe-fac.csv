The bulk of our digital photography is more than four years old and it\'s time to start refreshing it.\n\nI have been working with a number of you behind the scenes to identify students and faculty to be part of the shoot, and things are lining up pretty well. These initial two shoots will focus on life in and around the complex, our undergraduate programs, and some examples of the work we do with children and families. Future shoots will focus on other areas. The photographer will be accompanied at all times.\n\nWe are a little thin on male students and faculty for tomorrow\'s shoot. If you fit that description, are willing to be photographed, and are available between 9 and 11 a.m., and/or from 3:30-5 p.m., please let me know. Even if you don\'t fit that description but you have something going on that might be interesting to shoot during those times, let me know that as well. The same afternoon window (3:30-5) may be available on the 27th as well. We\'ll have releases with us.\n\nThe scheduled shoot aside, the talent and equipment exists right here in the COE to capture events on a one-off basis. If your daytime plans include something photogenic, on campus or off, please don\'t hesitate to contact me.\n\nCOE video capabilities\nOn a related note, the COE now has pretty robust video-production capabilities that include lighting, professional audio, visual effects, motion graphics and more.

The bulk of our digital photography is more than four years old and it's time to start refreshing it.\n\nI have been working with a number of you behind the scenes to identify students and faculty to be part of the shoot, and things are lining up pretty well. These initial two shoots will focus on life in and around the complex, our undergraduate programs, and some examples of the work we do with children and families. Future shoots will focus on other areas. The photographer will be accompanied at all times.\n\nWe are a little thin on male students and faculty for tomorrow's shoot. If you fit that description, are willing to be photographed, and are available between 9 and 11 a.m., and/or from 3:30-5 p.m., please let me know. Even if you don't fit that description but you have something going on that might be interesting to shoot during those times, let me know that as well. The same afternoon window (3:30-5) may be available on the 27th as well. We'll have releases with us.\n\nThe scheduled shoot aside, the talent and equipment exists right here in the COE to capture events on a one-off basis. If your daytime plans include something photogenic, on campus or off, please don't hesitate to contact me.\n\nCOE video capabilities\nOn a related note, the COE now has pretty robust video-production capabilities that include lighting, professional audio, visual effects, motion graphics and more. Starting in January, we would like to produce at least one new short video per month promoting the COE. Some will be serious, some will be whimsical, but there must  be a mix. All will try and capture the academic and social life, and the spirit/energy of the College.

Please pass this information along to any of your doctoral students who may be interested in this sequence. Students are better prepared for this course if they have had either the prerequisite research methods or a measurement course.\n\n  *   The Winter course covers (a) models of evaluation, (b) types of evaluation (e.g., needs assessment, implementation, outcome/impact), (c) measurement issues and approaches, (d) standards of evaluation, and (e) the development of an evaluation proposal. The product for the term is the completion of an evaluability assessment for an evaluation project and a proposal for an evaluation negotiated with a client. Please see below if you or someone you know has an existing evaluation need.\n  *   The Spring term, taken as practicum credits, involves completing the planned evaluation activities including the writing of a final evaluation report. Students who take only the Winter term negotiate that they will plan an evaluation for their client but not carry it out.\nRequest for Evaluation Topics: This e-mail is also an invitation to provide evaluation opportunities or projects appropriate for student completion (e.g., pieces of existing research projects, academic programs, or within community agencies you are affiliated). Evaluation projects should be of the scope that makes it possible for the planning to occur during winter term and the evaluation implemented AND completed at the end of spring term. For example, last year the FHS supervision of supervision model for the FHS student practicum was evaluated. Another evaluation was conducted in two middle schools measuring student\'s perception of school culture in schools implementing PBS. This evaluation was an expansion from an already funded grant, and the evaluators presented data from this evaluation in a conference poster session.\nPlease e-mail me directly a short description your ideas and projects prior to the start of winter term. I will present the evaluation opportunities early in the term for students to choose from and allow them to begin working with the client in the design of the evaluation. This activity is a valuable resource for students to provide them with evaluation experience with ""real data"" and also working directly with clients under guided supervision.\nPlease let me know if you have any questions or need additional information.\nSincerely,\nCHiXapkaid\n<a href=""https://lists-prod.uoregon.edu/mailman/listinfo/coe-fac"">dpavel at uoregon.edu</a>&lt;mailto:<a href=""https://lists-prod.uoregon.edu/mailman/listinfo/coe-fac"">dpavel at uoregon.edu</a>&gt;\n\n-------------- next part --------------\nAn HTML attachment was scrubbed...\nURL: &lt;<a href=""https://lists-prod.uoregon.edu/mailman/private/coe-fac/attachments/20121203/57d92493/attachment.html"">https://lists-prod.uoregon.edu/mailman/private/coe-fac/attachments/20121203/57d92493/attachment.html</a>&gt;\n</pre>'","b'Dear Colleagues:\nThe following is information about and request for evaluation topics for the college-wide doctoral seminar, Program Evaluation I & II sequence (EDUC 620 and 621).\nDescription of Course:  The winter/spring Program Evaluation sequence will be offered this year and the winter class is scheduled for Thursdays from 2:00 - 5:50.

2012-12-05 10:22:47,b'coe-fac: COE Web style guide',b'Cody Pinkston',b'cpinksto@uoregon.edu',b'http://lists-prod.uoregon.edu/pipermail/coe-fac/2012/000019.html',"b'<pre>Good Morning,\n\nAt yesterday\'s meeting, Jeff Woodbury alluded to style guidelines and conventions for the Web as a way to establish consistency across our website, at least as it relates to content. To assist content owners in this regard, we\'ve put together a COE style guide&lt;<a href=""https://coe.uoregon.edu/styleguide/"">https://coe.uoregon.edu/styleguide/</a>&gt;. It is meant to help answer questions about what to capitalize, how to abbreviate, and the like. Hopefully you will find it a useful resource. With your feedback, it will continue to grow and improve.\n\nThe biggest problems with consistency right now are:\n\n  *   Lists. Drupal can automatically format bulleted or numbered lists for you. Separate each element, or line, with the RETURN key, select the whole block of text, and then click whichever list icon you wish. A bullet or number will be inserted where you\'ve made line breaks. If you paste a list from another document, paste the plain text and remove existing numbers or bullets before applying the list style.\n  *   Spaces. Just hitting RETURN after a line is called a hard return, and it automatically adds a space between lines or paragraphs. Word-processing programs don\'t do that by default, so if you hit RETURN twice to add a line break, you\'re actually adding two.\n  *   Headings. Drupal offers a handful of options for formatting text. Most of your text will just use the ""Normal"" style. If you want a section heading, e.g. ""Degree Requirements,"" you should use ""Heading 3."" Heading 2 is part of the style sheet because it\'s the default main page title heading, but you shouldn\'t use it in your copy.\n  *   Hyperlinks. In general, avoid using the actual URL as the text for a hyperlink. But you should also avoid vague words or phrases. For example, say you want to link to information about academic advising. Avoid this: ""To learn more about academic advising, go to <a href=""https://education.uoregon.edu/student-academic-services/academic-advising."">https://education.uoregon.edu/student-academic-services/academic-advising.</a>"" By the same token, don\'t be too vague: ""To learn more about academic advising, click here&lt;<a href=""https://education.uoregon.edu/student-academic-services/academic-advising"">https://education.uoregon.edu/student-academic-services/academic-advising</a>&gt;."" The preferred way is to make the hyperlinked text descriptive of the destination and incidental to the wording, e.g. ""The COE offers dedicated academic advising services&lt;<a href=""https://education.uoregon.edu/student-academic-services/academic-advising"">https://education.uoregon.edu/student-academic-services/academic-advising</a>&gt; to help ensure steady progress toward your degree.""\n  *   Galleries. The spirit of a gallery is that it is updated relatively often with new photos. That\'s why, once you create one, it places thumbnails on your landing page with the heading, ""Recent photos."" In Drupal-speak, that means the most recently uploaded photos, not the most recently taken photos. If you want to re-order them, simply drag them around in the View window (from within your gallery, after you\'ve logged in) so the four you want to feature are the first four in the group (going across).\n\nUnfortunately, I need to address the erroneous, but apparently widespread, perception that the marketing office is in the business of changing people\'s website content without notice. To be clear, your content is YOUR content. The only changes site administrators would ever make without notifying you are the types listed above, which help ensure a clean, professional-looking website but do not materially affect the work you\'ve done to that point. It\'s the difference between straightening someone\'s tie for them and replacing it with a bandana while they\'re not paying attention. If you believe someone has substantially changed your content, a respectful inquiry can determine what happened, when, why, and how to fix it.\n\nCheers,\nCody\n\n________________________________\n[Description: Description: Description: Description: Description: Description: Description: Description: cid:3406876785_2874866]Cody Pinkston | Director of Marketing | <a href=""https://lists-prod.uoregon.edu/mailman/listinfo/coe-fac"">cpinksto at uoregon.edu</a>&lt;mailto:<a href=""https://lists-prod.uoregon.edu/mailman/listinfo/coe-fac"">cpinksto at uoregon.edu</a>&gt;\nCollege of Education, 270 Lokey Ed | 1215 University of Oregon, Eugene, OR 97403 | (P) 541-346-1392\n-------------- next part --------------\nAn HTML attachment was scrubbed...\nURL: &lt;<a href=""https://lists-prod.uoregon.edu/mailman/private/coe-fac/attachments/20121205/a6a9f1a7/attachment.html"">https://lists-prod.uoregon.edu/mailman/private/coe-fac/attachments/20121205/a6a9f1a7/attachment.html</a>&gt;\n-------------- next part --------------\nA non-text attachment was scrubbed...\nName: D3FCFDF2-990C-42BC-80F9-7F2EE26CB88C[12].png\nType: image/png\nSize: 2413 bytes\nDesc: D3FCFDF2-990C-42BC-80F9-7F2EE26CB88C[12].png\nURL: &lt;<a href=""https://lists-prod.uoregon.edu/mailman/private/coe-fac/attachments/20121205/a6a9f1a7/attachment.png"">https://lists-prod.uoregon.edu/mailman/private/coe-fac/attachments/20121205/a6a9f1a7/attachment.png</a>&gt;\n</pre>'","b'Good Morning,\n\nAt yesterday\'s meeting, Jeff Woodbury alluded to style guidelines and conventions for the Web as a way to establish consistency across our website, at least as it relates to content.

He will continue his research on Copyright, Media and Democracy in China. China is the world\'s fastest growing media market, but is a market evolving in the shadow of pervasive censorship.  Some Western scholars argue that copyright plays a key role in free discourse by enabling media producers to be self-sustaining and therefore freer from government largesse and control. China is now revising its copyright law. Does copyright law have the potential to promote a more independent media in China?\n\nPriest has been at the UO since 2009. He was a resident fellow at the Berkman Center for Internet and Society at Harvard Law School, where he researched internet content filtering in Asia for the OpenNet Initiative. He also worked in China as the CEO of Noank Creative Internet Technologies.\n\nProfessor Priest will co-teach a fall 2013 class on Advanced Topics in Intellectual Property Law with 2013 Wayne Morse Chair of Law and Politics William ""Terry"" Fisher.

Information is becoming politicized, and politics increasingly uses information in new and different ways.

Bullis, Kame\'enui and Baker,\n\nThis is a quick note that I hope you will share with your colleagues at the University of Oregon. We at the US-Norway Fulbright Foundation are trying to spread the word about our Roving Scholar grant-a unique Fulbright opportunity in Norway for those who have teaching experience, are interested in secondary education and have a keen interest in American Studies (history, geography, literature, cultural studies, etc.) Roving Scholars are based in Oslo but spend up to 50% of their time traveling all over Norway visiting secondary schools. Roving scholars are primarily guest speakers who engage secondary students in English on a variety of self-determined topics related to American Studies. A portion of their time is also spent offering workshops for teachers-in-service and teachers-in-training.  The Fulbright grant includes a healthy stipend, on top of which all travel expenses, including a generous per diem, are paid for by the Fulbright Roving Scholars Program. This unique opportunity is currently only available for U.S. Scholars to Norway.\n\nWe are seeking scholars who are interested in the intersection of the theory, policy, and practicalities of education. As a Roving Scholar, one is offered an unparalleled opportunity to build teaching experience in a new educational setting while forging professional and personal ties through hands-on academic immersion.\n\nWe are seeking applications from interested and qualified candidates, through the usual Fulbright process (deadline August 1 for the 2014-15 school year). Please note a Ph.D. is not required for this Fulbright grant. University faculty as well as field supervisors, adjuncts or lecturers, and experienced classroom teachers with master\'s degrees are encouraged to apply.\n\nFor more information please see our Roving Scholar Program web pages: <a href=""http://www.fulbright.no/RovingScholars."">http://www.fulbright.no/RovingScholars.</a>  Several Roving Scholar alumni are available to communicate with interested applicants. Please feel free to contact me, if you would like more information.\n\nThe program has been growing in recent years. Please help us recruit exceptional candidates by sharing this information with colleagues, or posting this information to relevant lists and emailing your educational contacts in other parts of the country.

Therefore, at this point, only those faculty who are unrepresented by the union are eligible for the merit raise. The list of eligible faculty was established through an extensive legal review process on the part of the union and the UO. I must be honest that the list of unrepresented faculty is short and most of you will not be eligible for this merit raise at this point in time.\n\nIn the next few weeks, we will be gathering personnel reviews on faculty who are  not represented by the union and eligible for the merit raise.

Eligible faculty and Officers of Administration in the COE will be recommended for raises by the end of the spring term with raises beginning July 1.\n\nIt is my understanding that part of the collective bargaining agreement will address the terms governing faculty salary adjustments in the future.

In 2013-2014, we will be offering tutoring services to struggling readers in the elementary grades, in Bethel School District. The program will be held at three of Bethel\'s schools, after school (approximately 2:15-3:15 p.m., or 3:00-4:00 p.m., depending on the time school lets out at participating sites). Tutoring sessions will begin in week 2 of each quarter and conclude in week 10 of each quarter. Selected Bethel students will participate in one hour of small group reading instruction per day, Monday through Thursday each week, delivered by trained tutors. Training will be held in two, 2-hour sessions during the first week of the term. UO students may volunteer to tutor, or tutor for credit, with the option of earning 1-2 credits depending on whether they teach a small group every day or tutor for only 2 days per week. I am hoping you can share this opportunity with your students or others in the community that may be interested in gaining teaching experience.\n\nI have attached the 2013-2014 tutor application.

2013-11-14 16:31:26,b'coe-fac: Merit Increase Process for Eligible Faculty Bargaining\tUnit Members',b'Mia Tuan',b'tuan@uoregon.edu',b'http://lists-prod.uoregon.edu/pipermail/coe-fac/2013/000051.html',"b'<pre>Dear Colleagues,\nAs you know, the University is in the process of implementing the first ever Collective Bargaining Agreement (CBA) for represented faculty. There are many moving parts to the CBA and the implementation work will be ongoing through this academic year and beyond. While institutional change of this magnitude comes with its share of bumps, we are all committed to working together to emerge a much more equitable, inclusive, and transparent organization.\nI write today about implementation of the merit salary increases for FY14 for eligible represented faculty. (FY 14 includes the time period from July 1, 2013 to June 30, 2014)\nIn addition to the two retroactive salary increases (1.5% each), the CBA also specifies a merit pool equivalent to 2% of salary for eligible represented faculty, retroactive to July 1, 2013.\nAs part of the CBA, all faculty in the College will have an opportunity to respond to policies pertaining to the criteria used to determine merit increases.\nThe Provost expects to have the list of eligible faculty available to us by November 22. It is important to note that all faculty may not be eligible for across-the-board or merit increases due to a variety of factors, such as hiring date and/or whether or not you are represented by the Union. If you have questions concerning your eligibility, we suggest you contact United Academics for more information (uauoregon.org).\nBecause we are working from an abbreviated timeline this year, we have decided to submit the proposed merit criteria to all faculty members within the COE at once to facilitate timely feedback. Below we provide an overview of our proposed criteria and procedures.\nIn the College of Education, department heads are working with college leadership to draw from our already established review practices in framing the process for merit raise recommendations for FY14. The proposed process is as follows:\n\n1.    Annual Review. Information from the most recent annual review routinely conducted by the department or research unit will form the basis of merit determinations. If no annual review is on file reflecting activities from calendar year 2012 or more recently, the faculty member will be reviewed according to established departmental/unit procedures. Generally, the procedure includes having faculty members submit written summaries of activities from the past year in distinct categories (e.g., teaching, research and scholarly activity, service and professional activity, and diversity enhancing activities). Summaries of activities may be supplemented through reference to particular sections of a faculty member\'s current CV. Please work with your department head to ensure that you have a current evaluation on file to assist in this process.\n\n\n\n2.    One-time, Expedited Review. Faculty who are in positions that have not been subject to annual reviews in the past (e.g. practicum supervisors) will be evaluated by their supervisors using available data (e.g. student feedback/evaluation and field placement coordinators\' feedback).\n\n\n\n3.    Department  Head or Unit Director Ratings. For the purpose of the FY13-14 merit increases, the department head or research unit director will assign a global rating of the faculty member\'s performance, taking into account that faculty member\'s position description/duties, utilizing the following descriptors: Does Not Meet Expectations; Meets Expectations; and Exceeds Expectations. The global ratings will reflect relative weighting in terms of teaching, research, and service based on the specific position and job classification (e.g., for lecturer positions with primarily teaching responsibilities, performance in teaching will be weighted more heavily than research).\n\n\n\n4.    Merit Increase Recommendation.  Only faculty who meet or exceed expectations will be eligible for a merit increase. The department head will make a recommendation for merit increase based on the global rating, and final adjustments will be made at the college level to ensure the proper accounting of the 2% merit pool. It is important to note here that the 2% merit pool for NTTF will be kept separate from the 2% pool for tenure line faculty to ensure that the full 2% is available to members of each respective group. The Provost or designee has final decision making authority regarding merit increases.\nIn order to meet the internal deadline of November 22, I invite you to provide your department head with your questions, feedback, thoughts, and concerns about this proposed process for FY14 merit increases for eligible represented faculty. Each department head will distribute information to their faculty about specific avenues to provide this feedback. Along with others in COE leadership, I will integrate your feedback as judiciously and respectfully as possible as we work in the College to finalize the process.\nThis is not the final word on how merit raises will be administered in our college. In fact, soon after we conclude these immediate implementation steps in the CBA, we will move to a more refined and deliberate process of working together with all faculty to clarify criteria for merit increases for FY15 and beyond.\nAs always, your collegial support in this process is much appreciated as we move forward together as an academic community.\nMia\n\n\n\n\n-------------- next part --------------\nAn HTML attachment was scrubbed...\nURL: &lt;<a href=""https://lists-prod.uoregon.edu/mailman/private/coe-fac/attachments/20131115/61f00551/attachment.html"">https://lists-prod.uoregon.edu/mailman/private/coe-fac/attachments/20131115/61f00551/attachment.html</a>&gt;\n</pre>'","b""Dear Colleagues,\nAs you know, the University is in the process of implementing the first ever Collective Bargaining Agreement (CBA) for represented faculty.

The Provost or designee has final decision making authority regarding merit increases.\nIn order to meet the internal deadline of November 22, I invite you to provide your department head with your questions, feedback, thoughts, and concerns about this proposed process for FY14 merit increases for eligible represented faculty. Each department head will distribute information to their faculty about specific avenues to provide this feedback. Along with others in COE leadership, I will integrate your feedback as judiciously and respectfully as possible as we work in the College to finalize the process.\nThis is not the final word on how merit raises will be administered in our college. In fact, soon after we conclude these immediate implementation steps in the CBA, we will move to a more refined and deliberate process of working together with all faculty to clarify criteria for merit increases for FY15 and beyond.\nAs always, your collegial support in this process is much appreciated as we move forward together as an academic community.\nMia\n\n\n\n\n-------------- next part --------------\nAn HTML attachment was scrubbed...\nURL: <https://lists-prod.uoregon.edu/mailman/private/coe-fac/attachments/20131115/61f00551/attachment.html>\n"""

In 2013-2014, we are offering tutoring services to struggling readers in the elementary grades, in Bethel School District. Our after school program serves three of Bethel\'s schools, approximately 2:15-3:15 p.m., or 3:00-4:00 p.m., depending on the time school lets out at participating sites. Tutoring sessions will begin in week 2 of each quarter and conclude in week 10 of each quarter. Selected Bethel students will participate in one hour of small group reading instruction per day, Monday through Thursday each week, delivered by trained tutors. Training will be held in two, 2-hour sessions during the first week of the term. UO students may volunteer to tutor, or tutor for credit, with the option of earning 1-2 credits depending on whether they teach a small group every day or tutor for only 2 days per week.

Though time consuming, it\'s tremendously important for our long-term operations and I hope all the depts/units are having robust discussions.

Article 4 of the CBA states that the ""faculty shall first consider any input provided by the appropriate department or unit head, dean, vice-president, Provost, or designee.""  The spirit of shared governance opens up this process by giving all faculty the opportunity to develop these policies, which will then be submitted ""to the appropriate dean, vp or designee for review.

I\'m sure this wasn\'t the intention, so faculty should know that this is just a starting place and that they can look at all aspects of the document.  This includes the voting matrix attached to the document. They can also examine other models from other departments.  There is also a tension between college-wide policies and dept policies that is not easily resolvable by the process described in the memo.  I guess we will see how different departments/units respond to this task and then decide a course of action.\nLastly, I\'d like to draw people\'s attention to the composition of the Faculty Personnel Committee (page 3).

I apologize if my intent in this email was unclear-let me clarify by saying that, as you develop your department/unit level internal governance policies, you are free to adopt the draft document entirely, start from scratch, or anything in between. In recognition of the need expressed by some units for more time to develop their internal governance policies, the deadline for input has been moved to March 7th (in lieu of February 28th).\n\nCore to the Collective Bargaining Agreement is the premise that ""all faculty in each department or unit shall have the opportunity to participate in the development of that department or unit\'s internal governance policy."" Your involvement in the development of your unit\'s policies is very important for the long-term credibility and legitimacy of these policies and I encourage you to participate in any way you see fit.

I invite volunteers to participate in several meetings from March 7th until March 21st to help develop the COE college-level internal governance draft document that provides the necessary structure, flexibility to accommodate diversity in department/unit level policies, and assurance of equitable participation by faculty in the governance process.

Drafts will be posted for five days and then a vote will be taken. Policies that are ratified will be forwarded to the Provost for final review.\n  *   For the COE college-level policy, the Dean\'s Office will post the policy draft for all faculty to review and provide additional input before ratification. The draft will be posted for five days and then a vote will be taken. Once the policy is ratified, it will be forwarded to the Provost for final review.\nWhatever your method of participation, I strongly encourage you to be involved in the development of these policies. Any policy document is a statement of principles of what we value and how we understand ourselves.

Drafts will be posted for five days and then a vote will be taken. Policies that are ratified will be forwarded to the Provost for final review.\n  *   For the COE college-level policy, the Dean\'s Office will post the policy draft for all faculty to review and provide additional input before ratification. The draft will be posted for five days and then a vote will be taken. Once the policy is ratified, it will be forwarded to the Provost for final review.\nWhatever your method of participation, I strongly encourage you to be involved in the development of these policies. Any policy document is a statement of principles of what we value and how we understand ourselves. Your voice and input are crucial at this important moment of clarifying and establishing our principles.\n\nBest wishes,\nMia\n\n________________________________\n[COE logo]\n\n\nMia Tuan | Interim Dean\ntuan at uoregon.edu<mailto:tuan at uoregon.edu> | 541.346.3405\n170 Lokey Ed | 1215 University of Oregon Eugene, OR 97403\n\n\n-------------- next part --------------\nAn HTML attachment was scrubbed...\nURL: <https://lists-prod.uoregon.edu/mailman/private/coe-fac/attachments/20140228/980789ca/attachment.html>\n'"

Like previous years, the Department is holding a pre-application process for one of the three grant categories, development grants.  These are the early stage proposals and have been the most popular in the past competitions.  Only the proposals that rank highest in the pre-proposal process will be invited to submit full proposals.  We\'re not expecting the other two types of grants (validation and scale-up) to have this pre-application process, and those solicitations are expected to be released this spring.\n\nPlease note that pre-applications are required and are due by April 14.\n\n\nFunding Opportunity:  ED Releases Call for Pre-applications for 2014 i3 Grant Competition\n\nLewis-Burke Associates LLC - March 19, 2014\n\n\nThe Department of Education (ED) recently released the pre-application for fiscal year (FY) 2014 Development grants within the Investing in Innovation (i3) program.  Interested applicants must submit a pre-application by April 14.  The purpose of the i3 program is to provide funding to develop or expand promising, innovative practices that improve education and student outcomes.  The grants also encourage partnerships between the private sector, non-profits, and local educational agencies (LEAs), and require non-profit applicants, like institutions of higher education, to demonstrate a strong partnership with an LEA.\n\n\n\nThe i3 program solicits grants in three categories: Development, Validation, and Scale-Up.  Each category requires an increasing amount of evidence and applicants are required to identify a category at the time of application.  Similar to previous years, the Department is requiring a pre-application for Development grants to streamline the process and reduce the burden for ED and its reviewers.  As a result of the pre-application process, the Department will invite selected applicants to submit a full-application for consideration.  The Scale-Up and Validation grant solicitations are not expected to include a pre-application process; these solicitations are expected to be released this spring.\n\n\nED has included six absolute priorities for the 2014 competition.  Similar to last year, subparts have been added for some priorities.  For priorities with subparts, applicants are required to choose and address one absolute priority and one of its subparts.\n\nThe absolute priorities and their subparts are:\n\n\n1.       Improving the Effectiveness of Teachers or Principals.\n\na.       ""Developing and implementing models for principal preparation that deepen leadership skills which have been demonstrated to improve student achievement [...].\n\nb.      Increasing the equitable access to effective teachers or principals for low-income and high-need students [...], which may include increasing the equitable distribution of effective teachers or principals for low-income and high-need students across schools.""\n\n2.       Improving Low-Performing Schools.\n\na.       ""Changing elements of the school\'s organizational design to improve instruction by differentiating staff roles and extending and enhancing instructional time.\n\nb.      Implementing programs, supports, or other strategies that improve students\' non-cognitive abilities (e.g., motivation, persistence or resilience) and enhance student engagement in learning or mitigate the effects of poverty, including physical, mental, or emotional health issues, on student engagement in learning.""\n\n3.       Improving Academic Outcomes for Students with Disabilities.\n\n4.       Improving Outcomes for English Learners (ELs).\n\na.       ""Increasing the number and proportion of ELs successfully completing courses in core academic subjects by developing, implementing, and evaluating new instructional approaches and tools that are sensitive to the language demands necessary to access challenging content, including technology-based tools.\n\nb.      Preparing ELs to be on track to be college- and career-ready when they graduate from high school by developing comprehensive, developmentally appropriate, early learning programs (birth-grade 3) that are aligned with the State\'s high-quality early learning standards, designed to improve readiness for kindergarten, and support development of literacy and academic skills in English or in English and another language.""\n\n5.       Effective Use of Technology.\n\na.       ""Providing access to learning experiences that are personalized, adaptive, and self-improving in order to optimize the delivery of instruction to learners with a variety of learning needs.\n\nb.      Integrating technology with the implementation of rigorous college- and career-ready standards to increase student achievement [...], student engagement, and teacher efficacy, such as by providing embedded, real-time assessment and feedback to students and teachers.""\n\n6.       Serving Rural Communities (note: applications submitted under this priority must identify an additional absolute priority and a subpart).\n\nIn addition to one absolutely priority, applications must ""propose projects designed to implement practices that serve students who are in grades K-12 at some point during the funding period.""  Also, as in previous years, the Department requires all i3 projects to demonstrate additional evidence of effectiveness and incorporate plans for an independent evaluation of the proposed project.\n\nEligibility:  Eligible applicants include local educational agencies (LEAs); LEAs partnered with nonprofit organizations, including institutions of higher education; and consortia of schools.  A matching requirement of 15 percent is required, and successful applications must demonstrate evidence of 50 percent of the required match prior to any award of a grant.\n\nKey Dates:\n\n*         Pre-Applications became available on March 17\n\n*         Deadline for Notice of Intent to Submit Pre-Application: April 3\n\n*         Deadline for Transmittal of Pre-Application: April 14\n\n\nFunding: The Department anticipates the availability of total grant funds for the i3 program amounting to $134.8 million.

For example, our authors consider the rapidly growing understanding of the human brain. They explore some of the ways in which the education profession has had to shift its perspective from a lack of understanding of functional brain organization to one in which such understanding can help to provide a foundation for improving our educational systems.\n\nOr, consider Information and Communication Technology (ICT), a major change agent. Children who grow up making routine use of ICT do not view this \xe2\x80\x9ccomplexity\xe2\x80\x9d in the same manner as adults who find some aspects of this rapidly changing technology to be such a challenge. These are only two of the complexities we are working to understand and master.\n\nThis new book is the fourth in a series based on the Information Age Education (IAE) Newsletters.

Download the Microsoft Word file from http://i-a-e.org/downloads/doc_download/255-understanding-and-mastering-complexity.html.\n\nThis new book from Sylwester and Moursund is designed for people interested in exploring ways that informal and formal education can help all of us to deal more easily with the complexity of many of our problems and tasks.\n\nProgress in research and development helps to simplify some complex problems, and also can add to the complexity of others. For example, our authors consider the rapidly growing understanding of the human brain. They explore some of the ways in which the education profession has had to shift its perspective from a lack of understanding of functional brain organization to one in which such understanding can help to provide a foundation for improving our educational systems.\n\nOr, consider Information and Communication Technology (ICT), a major change agent. Children who grow up making routine use of ICT do not view this \xe2\x80\x9ccomplexity\xe2\x80\x9d in the same manner as adults who find some aspects of this rapidly changing technology to be such a challenge. These are only two of the complexities we are working to understand and master.\n\nThis new book is the fourth in a series based on the Information Age Education (IAE) Newsletters. All of the books and newsletters are free.\n\nSylwester, R., & Moursund, D., eds. (June, 2013). Consciousness and Morality: Recent Research Developments. Eugene, OR: Information Age Education.

2014-10-01 09:04:41,b'coe-fac: COE Internal Governance Revisions',b'Randy Kamphaus',b'randyk@uoregon.edu',b'http://lists-prod.uoregon.edu/pipermail/coe-fac/2014/000097.html',"b'<pre>Dear COE Faculty:\n\nIn the winter and spring of this past academic year, our college began to engage in the important work of fully articulating the policies and processes by which we will govern ourselves in the future.  That work continues, and will require commitment and a sincere effort from us all going into the future.  I am writing today with some updates on the process of implementation of the faculty collective bargaining agreement that went into effect at roughly this time last year.\n\nFirst, the CBA implementation team, made up of representatives from United Academics and personnel at Academic Affairs, has reviewed our internal governance documents and provided feedback designed to assist us in ensuring that the requirements of the CBA are not lost or overlooked as we codify our practices.  The most significant of these requirements is the necessity to ensure ""appropriate and equitable participation"" in governance for both tenure-track and non-tenure track faculty, and I have attached language regarding this from the implementation team to this message.  This mandate exists both at the college level and the unit level, and the important first step in our work this fall is to return to the documents we developed last academic year to make necessary revisions in keeping with the CBA.  I have attached a line-numbered version of the COE Internal Governance Framework with some tracked edits and notes calling attention to areas that must be addressed.\n\nWhile the college\'s policy work is the purview of all faculty, I understand that gathering the 500+ members of the COE faculty in one place for a productive discussion is an impossible task.  That being said, I am asking for volunteers among the faculty to step forward and make their voices heard as part of a college-wide workgroup similar to the one that was convened last year to provide revised language to this office for review before we send the document back to you for your ratification.  Academic Affairs expects a ratified document by November 1, so our work must begin quickly and proceed quickly.  I propose the following:\n\n\n1.       Any faculty member interested in immediately beginning work on revising our COE Internal Governance Framework document should email my assistant Shaun Haskins (<a href=""https://lists-prod.uoregon.edu/mailman/listinfo/coe-fac"">haskins at uoregon.edu</a>&lt;mailto:<a href=""https://lists-prod.uoregon.edu/mailman/listinfo/coe-fac"">haskins at uoregon.edu</a>&gt;) directly to indicate their desire to participate in a college-wide workgroup.  In order to ensure that its work is undertaken quickly, requests to join this group will only be accepted until 5pm this Friday, October 3, and the first meeting of this group will take place 3:00-4:30pm next Wednesday, October 8.\n\n2.       This college-wide workgroup will have its membership announced broadly once it is assembled so that all faculty members can provide input and feedback to the members of the workgroup directly.\n\n3.       The workgroup shall be substantively finished with its policy development and submit the results to my office as soon as feasible.  At that time,  my office will make a review of the document and then submit it for college-wide ratification.  This will provide necessary time for unit-specific policies to be modified to be in accord with both the feedback provided by the implementation team and the COE-level policy document and to be ratified at the unit level.\n\nUnit-specific policies will need to be revised as well.  Brigid Flannery, our Interim Assistant Dean for Academic Affairs, will send the implementation team\'s feedback and some supporting documents to individual unit heads in the coming days, along with guidance to assist the unit faculty in revising and ratifying those documents.  I would ask you to return your revised unit-level policies to my office for review before the November 1 deadline.\n\nOnce we have successfully completed a revision of our internal governance policies that ensure appropriate and equitable participation for both TTF and NTTF, we will spend the remainder of the term engaged with the equally-important work of establishing policies around the assignment of professional responsibilities (workload) for NTTF.  My office and Academic Affairs will assist units in organizing to prepare for this work during the month of October, so that it will go as smoothly as possible during November and December.\n\nFor a view of the year\'s CBA implementation-related activities, you can refer to the timeline on the following website: <a href=""http://academicaffairs.uoregon.edu/cba-implementation-calendar"">http://academicaffairs.uoregon.edu/cba-implementation-calendar</a>\n\nI look forward to working with you all this year on these important activities.\n\nRandy\n-------------- next part --------------\nAn HTML attachment was scrubbed...\nURL: &lt;<a href=""https://lists-prod.uoregon.edu/mailman/private/coe-fac/attachments/20141001/513c6792/attachment-0001.html"">https://lists-prod.uoregon.edu/mailman/private/coe-fac/attachments/20141001/513c6792/attachment-0001.html</a>&gt;\n-------------- next part --------------\nA non-text attachment was scrubbed...\nName: COE Internal Governance Framework Revision 092914.docx\nType: application/vnd.openxmlformats-officedocument.wordprocessingml.document\nSize: 51864 bytes\nDesc: COE Internal Governance Framework Revision 092914.docx\nURL: &lt;<a href=""https://lists-prod.uoregon.edu/mailman/private/coe-fac/attachments/20141001/513c6792/attachment-0001.docx"">https://lists-prod.uoregon.edu/mailman/private/coe-fac/attachments/20141001/513c6792/attachment-0001.docx</a>&gt;\n</pre>'","b'Dear COE Faculty:\n\nIn the winter and spring of this past academic year, our college began to engage in the important work of fully articulating the policies and processes by which we will govern ourselves in the future.

Students may tutor two or four days per week.  Students may\ntutor for credit, to complete a field experience requirement, or to\nvolunteer.  This is an excellent opportunity for UO students who are\ninterested in instruction or literacy or are considering a career in K-12\neducation.\n\nI have attached the following documents:\n1) Program flyer.

In 2014-2015, we are offering tutoring services to struggling\nreaders in the elementary grades in the Bethel School District. Selected\nBethel students will participate in two hours of small group reading and\nwriting instruction per day, Monday through Thursday each week, delivered\nby trained tutors.\n\nTutors will receive training during Week 1 of the term, and begin teaching\nintervention groups in Week 2 (note: all tutoring takes place in Bethel\nschools).  Students may tutor two or four days per week.  Students may\ntutor for credit, to complete a field experience requirement, or to\nvolunteer.  This is an excellent opportunity for UO students who are\ninterested in instruction or literacy or are considering a career in K-12\neducation.\n\nI have attached the following documents:\n1) Program flyer.  If you have a door or display area in your department,\nwe would greatly appreciate your help in posting this flyer.\n2) Tutor information.

All faculty members and post-doctoral appointees are eligible to attend.\n\nThe seminar will be presented by Grant Writers Seminars and Workshops.  This organization, composed of successful university researchers, is well known for their comprehensive and high quality training programs for faculty investigators.

The trainer for our seminar is Peg AtKisson, Ph.D., previously a federally funded faculty member at Tufts University School of Medicine.   She founded Proposal Development Services at Tufts, assisting faculty there in competing successfully for external awards from a wide range of agencies and private funders.\n\nAll faculty registered will receive a comprehensive reference workbook in either NSF or NIH format provided as a part of their participation at no cost, courtesy of my office.  Postdoctoral appointees are also encouraged to attend, and the Research office will split the cost of their workbooks ($70) with their labs.\n\nPlease register with Research Development Services by contacting them at <a href=""https://lists-prod.uoregon.edu/mailman/listinfo/coe-fac"">rds at uoregon.edu</a>&lt;mailto:<a href=""https://lists-prod.uoregon.edu/mailman/listinfo/coe-fac"">rds at uoregon.edu</a>&gt; .

I appreciate the work of Lisa Fortin who provided us with a tasty lunch in a relaxed venue - Gerlinger Alumni Lounge. I also appreciated the opportunity to thank the committee members personally for their many hours of work. As a reminder, the combined list of members for these two groups is:\n\nSusan Boettcher\nTiffany Brown\nErin Chaparro\nRob Horner\nMark Horney\nShoshana Kerewsky\nJohanna Larson\nSeth May\nHeather Moore\nChris Murray\nDeborah Olson\nAlison Schmitke\nJo Smith\nMcKay Sohlberg\nMark Van Ryzin\n\nIn addition, Brigid Flannery devoted innumerable hours to this effort with the support of Shaun Haskins. Nice work, all.\n\nAs promised, I am providing copies of the policies as I will submit them to Academic Affairs. My changes and revisions are provided as are my rationales. Please see the \'comments\' boxes included. I did share this same feedback with the faculty in attendance at lunch, and received their questions and concerns.  Chief among these was the role of the FTE calculation spreadsheet that accompanied the policy document in making FTE decisions.\n\nAs follow up, I have an idea for expediting our work on the load ""calculators"" addressed in this draft. I propose asking Department and Research Unit Heads to use the calculators on a trial basis this year, and submit the results for analysis by NTTF faculty/committee, Brigid, and myself. This process would give us data from a real world trial that could inform any future consideration of the method, and provide information on the philosophical and practical implications of the use of this tool for our college. With this information COE would be better prepared to consider any necessary revisions of the calculator, or to consider alternative approaches. Of course, we would have to be careful to analyze only group data so that we do not violate the personnel confidentiality of individual NTTF faculty.\n\nFor now, we turn our attention to the TTF policies. I thank you for your effort and collaboration in this important governance work.\n\nRegards,\n\nRandy\n\n-------------- next part --------------\nAn HTML attachment was scrubbed...\nURL: &lt;<a href=""http://lists-prod.uoregon.edu/pipermail/coe-fac/attachments/20150206/00b83449/attachment-0001.html"">http://lists-prod.uoregon.edu/pipermail/coe-fac/attachments/20150206/00b83449/attachment-0001.html</a>&gt;\n-------------- next part --------------\nA non-text attachment was scrubbed...\nName: NTTFPromotion2015FinalRWKdocreviewmode.docx\nType: application/vnd.openxmlformats-officedocument.wordprocessingml.document\nSize: 82065 bytes\nDesc: NTTFPromotion2015FinalRWKdocreviewmode.docx\nURL: &lt;<a href=""http://lists-prod.uoregon.edu/pipermail/coe-fac/attachments/20150206/00b83449/attachment-0002.docx"">http://lists-prod.uoregon.edu/pipermail/coe-fac/attachments/20150206/00b83449/attachment-0002.docx</a>&gt;\n-------------- next part --------------\nA non-text attachment was scrubbed...\nName: NTTFWorkloadPolicy2015FinalRWKdocreviewmode.docx\nType: application/vnd.openxmlformats-officedocument.wordprocessingml.document\nSize: 61897 bytes\nDesc: NTTFWorkloadPolicy2015FinalRWKdocreviewmode.docx\nURL: &lt;<a href=""http://lists-prod.uoregon.edu/pipermail/coe-fac/attachments/20150206/00b83449/attachment-0003.docx"">http://lists-prod.uoregon.edu/pipermail/coe-fac/attachments/20150206/00b83449/attachment-0003.docx</a>&gt;\n-------------- next part --------------\nA non-text attachment was scrubbed...\nName: FTE Calculator final-1.xlsx\nType: application/vnd.openxmlformats-officedocument.spreadsheetml.sheet\nSize: 86455 bytes\nDesc: FTE Calculator final-1.xlsx\nURL: &lt;<a href=""http://lists-prod.uoregon.edu/pipermail/coe-fac/attachments/20150206/00b83449/attachment-0001.xlsx"">http://lists-prod.uoregon.edu/pipermail/coe-fac/attachments/20150206/00b83449/attachment-0001.xlsx</a>&gt;\n</pre>'","b'Dear Faculty,\n\nWe had a wonderful meeting Wednesday where we discussed the results of the faculty work on these policies.

2015-06-19 16:42:43,b'coe-fac: Request for Volunteers: COE Faculty Advisory Council',b'Shaun Haskins',b'haskins@uoregon.edu',b'http://lists-prod.uoregon.edu/pipermail/coe-fac/2015/000152.html',"b'<pre>Dear COE Faculty:\n\nAt our faculty-staff meeting in May, I indicated my desire to increase the participation of faculty in the day-to-day governance of the College in some key areas. Specifically, I find that we have had few mechanisms in the past to gather faculty input on communications to external policy and regulatory entities, and that I often wish I had a more direct connection to the will of the faculty when considering mundane matters concerning the direction of the college. I recently met with a group of volunteers from the faculty and staff and am pleased to announce that together we built a model that I believe will get us on the right path. The other participants in this conversation were:\n\nMark Horney, CATE\nRichelle Krotts, Office of the Dean\nDeanna Linville, CPHS\nDeb Olson, SPECS\nAlison Schmitke, EDST\n\nBefore asking for volunteers, let me take a moment to provide some more details on what we decided.\n\nFirst, our collective sense was that this group should not be overly large in order to make it easier to meet routinely throughout the academic year. I have settled on 6 as a starting number.\n\nSecond, we agreed that this group should be convened on an ad hoc basis for its first two years, to provide me and the members latitude to determine what the long-term charge, structure and mode of operation for this group should be before we attempt to codify it in our internal governance policies.\n\nThird, it was clear from our discussions that because the issues this group will tackle are overwhelmingly (but not exclusively) academic in nature, the composition should be primarily (but not exclusively) faculty from our academic departments. I believe 4 instructional faculty, 1 research faculty and 1 clinical/outreach faculty member should provide a good starting point. Further, because the purpose of the group is to offer a sense of collective faculty wisdom in addition to personal perspectives, only faculty in their second or later year of employment with the College and with an appointment at .75 FTE or higher will be eligible to serve. My hope is that the faculty selected for this committee will represent a broad range of instructional activities across our undergraduate, masters and doctoral programs.\n\nFourth, I have a secondary objective in convening this group. I hope to provide additional opportunities for professional development of our faculty in the area of leadership, and I believe service on a body like this one will offer meaningful exposure to and engagement with the issues and concerns of department heads, associate deans, and deans in the management of an academic enterprise like ours.  In order to maximize these opportunities for all faculty, as well as to provide some continuity, my plan is to have a mix of one-year and two-year appointments in this body.\n\nFinally, let me emphasize the importance of this service to my job as well as to the college as a whole. Participation on this body will be a real commitment, and I expect that we will meet biweekly for as long as ninety minutes per session. Given those expectations, consistent attendance and a high level of participation will be baseline expectations of service. I do not want anyone to be surprised by the demands I plan to make of this group both as we negotiate its ultimate role and moving forward in service to the college.\n\nIf you are interested in serving, please contact Shaun Haskins (<a href=""https://lists-prod.uoregon.edu/mailman/listinfo/coe-fac"">haskins at uoregon.edu</a>&lt;mailto:<a href=""https://lists-prod.uoregon.edu/mailman/listinfo/coe-fac"">haskins at uoregon.edu</a>&gt;) to submit your name for consideration before the close of business on September 28, 2015.\n\nThank you,\n\nRandy\n-------------- next part --------------\nAn HTML attachment was scrubbed...\nURL: &lt;<a href=""http://lists-prod.uoregon.edu/pipermail/coe-fac/attachments/20150619/5843a4da/attachment.html"">http://lists-prod.uoregon.edu/pipermail/coe-fac/attachments/20150619/5843a4da/attachment.html</a>&gt;\n</pre>'","b'Dear COE Faculty:\n\nAt our faculty-staff meeting in May, I indicated my desire to increase the participation of faculty in the day-to-day governance of the College in some key areas.

Please forward to prospective students you think will benefit from these classes.\nEDLD 610 Intro Mixture Models - Mondays, 9:00am-12:50pm, 4 credits taught by Mark Van Ryzin\n\nThis course will review Mixture Models, a group of techniques that evaluate the potential for distinct sub-groups or classes within a sample. The course will use Mplus for Latent Class Analysis, CACE modeling, and Growth Mixture Modeling, and will use SAS for Latent Class Trajectory Analysis (i.e., Proc Traj)\n\n\n\nPrerequisite: Students in the class will be expected to have a working knowledge of regression and to understand the basics of growth models, but will not be expected to know the specifics of Mplus or SAS.\n\nEDLD 625 Survey and Questionnaire Design- Wednesdays, 4:00pm-7:50pm, 4 credits taught by Mike Bullis\nThe course is designed for graduate students who have completed an introductory research design course and a statistics course. The course will offer an overview of the core aspects of the survey process. At various points in the course, faculty will be invited to discuss surveys they have, or are, conducting.\n\nThe primary product of the course is a proposal describing a survey project that will, or could be, conducted. Accordingly, it is essential for the student to have a solid idea for such a project before the course begins.\n\nEDLD 659 Scholarly Writing  - Tuesdays, 1:00pm-3:50pm, 4 credits taught by Mike Bullis\nThe course is designed for advanced doctoral students who are at the point of preparing, or starting to prepare, a manuscript for professional publication.

I\'m writing today to offer a brief reminder that all instructional Career Track faculty (NTTF) in the COE are expected to work with their supervisors (Department Head or Program Director) to complete an estimate of their workload for this year using the FTE Calculator Tool and offer feedback via survey to the NTTF Workload Policy Development committee. This estimate should be completed by the end of October. I have copied and pasted the Dean\'s previous message (from June) on this topic below.\n\nFor quick reference: the NTTF workload policy and supporting documentation, including the FTE calculator tool, are all available here:\n\n<a href=""https://coedocs.uoregon.edu/confluence/display/NTTFWP/NTTF+Workload+Policy+Home"">https://coedocs.uoregon.edu/confluence/display/NTTFWP/NTTF+Workload+Policy+Home</a>\n\nThe survey to provide your feedback can be found at the link below:\n\n<a href=""https://oregon.qualtrics.com/SE/?SID=SV_doqwEPreGvwDSgR"">https://oregon.qualtrics.com/SE/?SID=SV_doqwEPreGvwDSgR</a>\n\nRegards, and thank you all for participating in this important policy development work.\n\nShaun Haskins\nExecutive Assistant to the Dean\nCollege of Education\n1215 University of Oregon\nEugene, OR 97403\n541.346.1218\n\n\nDear COE Faculty:\n\nLast Fall, a group of our colleagues developed a policy to guide and govern the composition of FTE for Career Track (the name I prefer over non-tenure track) instructional faculty within the COE. One of the comments I provided to them at the time that policy was submitted to the UO administration was that the FTE Calculator tool attached to it should receive further testing and vetting by the faculty at large to determine whether it serves the purposes the policy workgroup envisioned for it and whether there are ways that it could be refined to improve its accuracy.\n\nAs a result of my conversations with the workload policy development group, I have asked the academic department heads to perform a ""test-run"" estimation of FTE using the tool for each of their instructional career track faculty before the end of October 2015. The group has spent a generous amount of time developing resources to aid department heads, academic program coordinators, and Career Track Faculty in the use of this tool, as well as a survey to collect data on several aspects of its use.\n\nIn order to support our Career Track Faculty and the efforts of the workload committee, I would like to encourage all instructional Career Track faculty (NTTF) in the COE to follow the link below to learn more about the FTE Calculator and to take time to use the tool along with your supervisor (department head or program director) to create an estimate of FTE for your expected workload for the upcoming year, and then follow the second link below to provide feedback to the policy group once you have done so.\n\nMore information about the policy and the calculator tool, as well as the tool itself, can be found at:\n\n<a href=""https://coedocs.uoregon.edu/confluence/display/NTTFWP/NTTF+Workload+Policy+Home"">https://coedocs.uoregon.edu/confluence/display/NTTFWP/NTTF+Workload+Policy+Home</a>\n\nProvide your feedback on the tool once you have used it with your supervisor via the survey below:\n\n<a href=""https://oregon.qualtrics.com/SE/?SID=SV_doqwEPreGvwDSgR"">https://oregon.qualtrics.com/SE/?SID=SV_doqwEPreGvwDSgR</a>\n\nI look forward to a discussion in the Fall about what this pilot effort tells us about the tool and our ongoing efforts to guarantee that the principles of equity and fairness are upheld in the distribution of workload within the College.\n\nWith gratitude to all who worked on these policies,\n\nRandy\n\n-------------- next part --------------\nAn HTML attachment was scrubbed...\nURL: &lt;<a href=""http://lists-prod.uoregon.edu/pipermail/coe-fac/attachments/20150921/e1460f10/attachment.html"">http://lists-prod.uoregon.edu/pipermail/coe-fac/attachments/20150921/e1460f10/attachment.html</a>&gt;\n</pre>'","b'Dear COE Faculty:\n\nI hope that you had a productive, pleasant and regenerative summer!

One of the comments I provided to them at the time that policy was submitted to the UO administration was that the FTE Calculator tool attached to it should receive further testing and vetting by the faculty at large to determine whether it serves the purposes the policy workgroup envisioned for it and whether there are ways that it could be refined to improve its accuracy.\n\nAs a result of my conversations with the workload policy development group, I have asked the academic department heads to perform a ""test-run"" estimation of FTE using the tool for each of their instructional career track faculty before the end of October 2015. The group has spent a generous amount of time developing resources to aid department heads, academic program coordinators, and Career Track Faculty in the use of this tool, as well as a survey to collect data on several aspects of its use.\n\nIn order to support our Career Track Faculty and the efforts of the workload committee, I would like to encourage all instructional Career Track faculty (NTTF) in the COE to follow the link below to learn more about the FTE Calculator and to take time to use the tool along with your supervisor (department head or program director) to create an estimate of FTE for your expected workload for the upcoming year, and then follow the second link below to provide feedback to the policy group once you have done so.\n\nMore information about the policy and the calculator tool, as well as the tool itself, can be found at:\n\nhttps://coedocs.uoregon.edu/confluence/display/NTTFWP/NTTF+Workload+Policy+Home\n\nProvide your feedback on the tool once you have used it with your supervisor via the survey below:\n\nhttps://oregon.qualtrics.com/SE/?SID=SV_doqwEPreGvwDSgR\n\nI look forward to a discussion in the Fall about what this pilot effort tells us about the tool and our ongoing efforts to guarantee that the principles of equity and fairness are upheld in the distribution of workload within the College.\n\nWith gratitude to all who worked on these policies,\n\nRandy\n\n-------------- next part --------------\nAn HTML attachment was scrubbed...\nURL: <http://lists-prod.uoregon.edu/pipermail/coe-fac/attachments/20150921/e1460f10/attachment.html>\n'"

Read below to learn more about.....\n2014-2015: Year in review\n\n*         New or Changes to Courses\n\n*         New or Changes to Programs, Specializations, Certificates\n2015-2016\n\n*         Curriculum Committee membership\n\n*         New website for curriculum materials calendar and information sheets\n\n*         EDUC scheduling and course instructor nomination\n\n*         Courseleaf as our electronic curriculum management system\n\n*         Collegewide course on foundations of educational research course\n\n*         Revision of COE Curriculum Policy\n\n*         Online course development initiative\nReview of 2014-2015\nCurriculum committee approved a number of new or changes to courses.\nFall term: Three courses were reviewed. All were approved and were modifications of existing courses (no new courses). No courses were returned to faculty for further action and no courses were denied.\nWinter term: Thirteen total courses were reviewed. Eight were approved including five current course modifications and three new courses. None of these courses were returned to faculty for further action, two courses were placed on hold pending the approval of the Prevention Science proposals, and three course changes were denied primarily due to duplication or low enrollment.\nSpring term: Seven total courses were reviewed. Three current courses were approved and no new courses. Four courses were returned to faculty for further action and no courses were denied.  The returned courses were a series proposed by FHS to form an Early Childhood Emphasis (FHS-ECE). These will be resubmitted in fall.\nThree new graduate programs (MA, MEd and PhD) were proposed and approved by COE in Prevention Science and Health Promotion (CPHS). These degrees will be in CPHS. These programs have now been approved by the Graduate Council, Senate, Board of Trustees and Provosts\' Council. It will go through its final approval step early this fall. This was the first program approval for COE under the new Board of Trustees structure so had a few bumps but we now know the process - thanks to all who worked on this proposal process.\nOne new specialization has progressed to the Graduate School. This is a specialization in Higher Education Administration that will be part of a Master\'s degree in EMPL.  The Committee reviewed the initial proposal in spring of 2014. The Committee also completed an initial review of a FHS minor last spring.  The FHS program was provided feedback and will be formally submitting again in fall 2015.\nLooking Ahead to 2015-2016 Academic Year\nThere is a lot already planned for 2015-2016 so for a sneak-peek read below:\nThere have been some changes in the COE Curriculum Committee membership.  There is one TTF and one CNTTF from each department on this committee. Please note the faculty representing your program. If you have questions regarding the curriculum process, please contact them or myself.  If you submit new courses or programs or changes to existing programs/courses to the committee be sure that you department representative is familiar with these. If they can address questions of the committee members it could move your proposal along more quickly.\n\no   EMPL: Gina Biancarosa, Jo Smith\n\no   EDST: Lisa Mazzei, Jeanne Hall\n\no   SPECS: Chris Murray, Angie Whalen\n\no   CPHS: Deanna Linville-Knobelspiesse, Kathy Moxley-South\nThe committee is only one step in the process. Please participate in the commenting and approval of courses, programs, specializations. Besides some new/changes to courses there are a number of discussions are happening in departments/programs for new minors, specializations and certificates such as: Undergraduate secondary education (Certificate), Leadership (Minor), FHS (Minor), Research Methodology (Specialization).\nThere is a new COE Academic Affairs website <a href=""https://coe.uoregon.edu/governance/curriculum-review-policies."">https://coe.uoregon.edu/governance/curriculum-review-policies.</a> This site will have the most current information related to COE curriculum - information sheets, UO links, and college curriculum calendars. There is a calendar of the critical dates for this year along with the forms and information sheets on the Academic Affairs site. You can find information about the process for courses, programs (majors, minors) and other topics. Be sure to get the most current syllabus template when submitting new courses or course changes to the COE Curriculum Committee. Not using the template could cause unnecessary delays in the submission of your proposal.\nIn addition, check the calendar as I will also host an ""orientation"" each term for faculty who are thinking of submitting a course, program, or specialization.  Please plan to attend these prior to your submission to be sure you understand the requirements and process.  The orientation this fall is Fri, Nov 13 -1-2pm, HEDCO 230U.\n                The EDUC courses are scheduled for next year (the schedule for 2016-2019 will be available by March, 2016). You can find the course listing on the policy site mentioned above.  The course times have been set in advance in order to allow all programs to schedule around them.  They are reviewed each year by department heads and the Student Service Coordinators. Please remember that the instructors for EDUC courses are determined through a two-step process. First is through self nomination. The materials for nomination and the requirements are available on the Academic Affairs site. This year these will be due on February 20, 2016. The second step is review and discussion by the Department Head Council. This full process is scheduled to be completed by spring break.\nStarting this Fall, the UO will use CourseLeaf as our electronic curriculum management system (<a href=""https://nextcatalog.uoregon.edu/courseadmin"">https://nextcatalog.uoregon.edu/courseadmin</a>). As before, the Student Services Coordinators will support the use of this system, but any faculty will be able to initiate the process to change a course or propose a new one. Program or department-level approval will be managed within the unit, but will require department head approval to begin moving through the CourseLeaf system for COE level faculty voting and comment. CourseLeaf does have ""help"" (available by hovering over an item in the interface) but training will be available at our quarterly curriculum orientations, and a tip sheet is available at: <a href=""https://coe.uoregon.edu/governance/curriculum-review-policies"">https://coe.uoregon.edu/governance/curriculum-review-policies</a>\n\nWhen the current version of the COE Curriculum Policy was developed in 2008, it stated that the foundations of educational research course would be offered in 2007-2008 using the existing course TED 610, Philosophy of Research, but the course will eventually have an EDUC course prefix. This has never been addressed. Since there are no department faculty to start this process and it should be a collegewide group, in the spring of 2015 I made a call for faculty to serve on an ad hoc subcommittee to the Curriculum Committee to design an EDUC course on foundations of educational research and submit it through the COE curriculum process. This committee will begin its work in the fall and target completion by spring term (or if possible by winter term so can be reviewed at the spring UOCC meeting and approved by Fall 2016).\nGina Biancarosa will chair this committee. The faculty volunteers who will comprise the committee are:\n\no   EMPL: Gina Biancarosa, Mike Bullis\n\no   EDST: Lisa Mazzei, Jerry Rosiek\n\no   SPECS: Rob Horner, Kent McIntosh\n\no   CPHS: Atika Kurhana, Elizabeth Skowron\nThe COE Curriculum Policy needs to be updated due to changes from CBA and COE procedures. This was begun with some clarification from Department Head Council and will now go to a subcommittee of the COE Curriculum Committee.  The committee will propose comments/changes to the Curriculum Committee and then post the proposed policy for COE faculty comment and vote.  This work is targeted for Fall and winter term with a faculty vote by end of school year (May 2016).\nIn response to faculty requests, and in the interest of facilitating curricular experimentation, the College is supporting a new small grant program designed to adapt existing coursework to online or hybrid delivery formats. This initiative will provide financial and expertise support to faculty who would like to convert a currently offered course in COE into an online format. A total of five to ten grants will be awarded depending on the availability of donor funds.

All were approved and were modifications of existing courses (no new courses). No courses were returned to faculty for further action and no courses were denied.\nWinter term: Thirteen total courses were reviewed. Eight were approved including five current course modifications and three new courses. None of these courses were returned to faculty for further action, two courses were placed on hold pending the approval of the Prevention Science proposals, and three course changes were denied primarily due to duplication or low enrollment.\nSpring term: Seven total courses were reviewed. Three current courses were approved and no new courses. Four courses were returned to faculty for further action and no courses were denied.  The returned courses were a series proposed by FHS to form an Early Childhood Emphasis (FHS-ECE). These will be resubmitted in fall.\nThree new graduate programs (MA, MEd and PhD) were proposed and approved by COE in Prevention Science and Health Promotion (CPHS). These degrees will be in CPHS. These programs have now been approved by the Graduate Council, Senate, Board of Trustees and Provosts\' Council. It will go through its final approval step early this fall. This was the first program approval for COE under the new Board of Trustees structure so had a few bumps but we now know the process - thanks to all who worked on this proposal process.\nOne new specialization has progressed to the Graduate School. This is a specialization in Higher Education Administration that will be part of a Master\'s degree in EMPL.  The Committee reviewed the initial proposal in spring of 2014. The Committee also completed an initial review of a FHS minor last spring.  The FHS program was provided feedback and will be formally submitting again in fall 2015.\nLooking Ahead to 2015-2016 Academic Year\nThere is a lot already planned for 2015-2016 so for a sneak-peek read below:\nThere have been some changes in the COE Curriculum Committee membership.  There is one TTF and one CNTTF from each department on this committee. Please note the faculty representing your program. If you have questions regarding the curriculum process, please contact them or myself.  If you submit new courses or programs or changes to existing programs/courses to the committee be sure that you department representative is familiar with these. If they can address questions of the committee members it could move your proposal along more quickly.\n\no   EMPL: Gina Biancarosa, Jo Smith\n\no   EDST: Lisa Mazzei, Jeanne Hall\n\no   SPECS: Chris Murray, Angie Whalen\n\no   CPHS: Deanna Linville-Knobelspiesse, Kathy Moxley-South\nThe committee is only one step in the process. Please participate in the commenting and approval of courses, programs, specializations. Besides some new/changes to courses there are a number of discussions are happening in departments/programs for new minors, specializations and certificates such as: Undergraduate secondary education (Certificate), Leadership (Minor), FHS (Minor), Research Methodology (Specialization).\nThere is a new COE Academic Affairs website https://coe.uoregon.edu/governance/curriculum-review-policies. This site will have the most current information related to COE curriculum - information sheets, UO links, and college curriculum calendars. There is a calendar of the critical dates for this year along with the forms and information sheets on the Academic Affairs site. You can find information about the process for courses, programs (majors, minors) and other topics. Be sure to get the most current syllabus template when submitting new courses or course changes to the COE Curriculum Committee. Not using the template could cause unnecessary delays in the submission of your proposal.\nIn addition, check the calendar as I will also host an ""orientation"" each term for faculty who are thinking of submitting a course, program, or specialization.  Please plan to attend these prior to your submission to be sure you understand the requirements and process.  The orientation this fall is Fri, Nov 13 -1-2pm, HEDCO 230U.\n                The EDUC courses are scheduled for next year (the schedule for 2016-2019 will be available by March, 2016). You can find the course listing on the policy site mentioned above.  The course times have been set in advance in order to allow all programs to schedule around them.  They are reviewed each year by department heads and the Student Service Coordinators. Please remember that the instructors for EDUC courses are determined through a two-step process. First is through self nomination. The materials for nomination and the requirements are available on the Academic Affairs site. This year these will be due on February 20, 2016. The second step is review and discussion by the Department Head Council. This full process is scheduled to be completed by spring break.\nStarting this Fall, the UO will use CourseLeaf as our electronic curriculum management system (https://nextcatalog.uoregon.edu/courseadmin). As before, the Student Services Coordinators will support the use of this system, but any faculty will be able to initiate the process to change a course or propose a new one. Program or department-level approval will be managed within the unit, but will require department head approval to begin moving through the CourseLeaf system for COE level faculty voting and comment. CourseLeaf does have ""help"" (available by hovering over an item in the interface) but training will be available at our quarterly curriculum orientations, and a tip sheet is available at: https://coe.uoregon.edu/governance/curriculum-review-policies\n\nWhen the current version of the COE Curriculum Policy was developed in 2008, it stated that the foundations of educational research course would be offered in 2007-2008 using the existing course TED 610, Philosophy of Research, but the course will eventually have an EDUC course prefix. This has never been addressed. Since there are no department faculty to start this process and it should be a collegewide group, in the spring of 2015 I made a call for faculty to serve on an ad hoc subcommittee to the Curriculum Committee to design an EDUC course on foundations of educational research and submit it through the COE curriculum process. This committee will begin its work in the fall and target completion by spring term (or if possible by winter term so can be reviewed at the spring UOCC meeting and approved by Fall 2016).\nGina Biancarosa will chair this committee. The faculty volunteers who will comprise the committee are:\n\no   EMPL: Gina Biancarosa, Mike Bullis\n\no   EDST: Lisa Mazzei, Jerry Rosiek\n\no   SPECS: Rob Horner, Kent McIntosh\n\no   CPHS: Atika Kurhana, Elizabeth Skowron\nThe COE Curriculum Policy needs to be updated due to changes from CBA and COE procedures. This was begun with some clarification from Department Head Council and will now go to a subcommittee of the COE Curriculum Committee.  The committee will propose comments/changes to the Curriculum Committee and then post the proposed policy for COE faculty comment and vote.  This work is targeted for Fall and winter term with a faculty vote by end of school year (May 2016).\nIn response to faculty requests, and in the interest of facilitating curricular experimentation, the College is supporting a new small grant program designed to adapt existing coursework to online or hybrid delivery formats. This initiative will provide financial and expertise support to faculty who would like to convert a currently offered course in COE into an online format. A total of five to ten grants will be awarded depending on the availability of donor funds. Please see the attached proposal for more information including eligibility, course requirements, resources, and  intellectual property rights.\n\nEnjoy your 2015-2016 academic year and look forward to your participation in the curriculum activities this year.\nBrigid\n\n\n-------------- next part --------------\nAn HTML attachment was scrubbed...\nURL: <http://lists-prod.uoregon.edu/pipermail/coe-fac/attachments/20150930/793500dc/attachment-0001.html>\n-------------- next part --------------\nA non-text attachment was scrubbed...\nName: COEOn-lineDevGrantannoucement-applicationAug2015.docx\nType: application/vnd.openxmlformats-officedocument.wordprocessingml.document\nSize: 24776 bytes\nDesc: COEOn-lineDevGrantannoucement-applicationAug2015.docx\nURL: <http://lists-prod.uoregon.edu/pipermail/coe-fac/attachments/20150930/793500dc/attachment-0001.docx>\n'"

The Senate voted 78-20 on a \xe2\x80\x9cclean\xe2\x80\x9d CR, which did not include a provision to defund Planned Parenthood for which some Republican members had advocated, and the House voted 277-151, with 91 Republicans joining 186 Democrats to pass the final bill.  All federal agencies, programs, and projects will be funded at FY 2015 levels, except for a 0.2 percent across-the-board cut to adhere to statutory spending caps.  The CR also prohibits the start of any new projects or activities proposed in the FY 2016 budget.  An extension of the authorization of the Department of Education\xe2\x80\x99s (ED) National Advisory Committee on Institutional Quality and Integrity (NACIQI) was included in the temporary funding measure.\n\nWashington\xe2\x80\x99s attention has also been focused on Speaker of the House John Boehner (R-OH) who announced his retirement on September 25. The House is expected to hold elections for a replacement on October 8.  The leading candidate for the position is Rep. Kevin McCarthy (R-CA).\n\nOn October 2, the White House announced another leadership change with U.S. Secretary of Education Arne Duncan leaving the Department of Education at the end of December.  Secretary Duncan has served in this leadership role since President Obama took office in 2009.  John B. King, Jr., Senior Advisor Delegated Duties of Deputy Secretary of Education, is expected to serve as the interim secretary.\n\nIN THIS ISSUE\n\nCONGRESSIONAL UPDATES AND NEWS\nHigher Education Act, Perkins Loan Program, and Advisory Committee on Student Financial Assistance Expire\nHouse Education and the Workforce Committee Holds Hearing on Campus Sexual Assault\nSenate Homeland Security and Government Affairs Committee Holds Hearing on the Department of Education\nJoint Economic Committee Holds Hearing on Financing Higher Education\nEducation Coalitions Submit Community Letter Opposing IES Funding Cuts\nCongress Pushes to Modify FERPA for Student Medical Records\n\nFEDERAL AGENCY AND ADMINISTRATION UPDATES AND NEWS\nAdvisory Committee on Student Financial Assistance Holds Hearing\nWhite House Task Force to Protect Students from Sexual Assault Releases Resources\nAdministration Unveils New College Scorecard\nDepartment of Education Announces Earlier FAFSA Application; Recommendations for FAFSA Simplification\nDepartment of Education Releases New Report on Student Borrower Protections\n\n________________________________\nCONGRESSIONAL UPDATES AND NEWS\nHigher Education Act, Perkins Loan Program, and Advisory Committee on Student Financial Assistance Expire\nThe end of the fiscal year marked the expiration of the Higher Education Act (HEA) authorization; though the vast majority of activities under HEA can operate without a current authorization.  The Federal Perkins Loan Program, however, as well as the Advisory Committee on Student Financial Assistance (ACSFA), and NACIQI all required authorization extensions.\n\nDespite a late push for revival, the Perkins Loan program expired at midnight on September 30.  The program, which provided low-interest loans to college students with high financial need, was nearly saved by a bipartisan reauthorization bill that sailed through the House earlier this week.  This effort was ultimately blocked in the Senate, due largely to opposition from Senate Health, Education, Labor and Pensions Committee Chairman Lamar Alexander (R-TN).  Although institutions have lost the authority to authorize new Perkins loans, grandfathering provisions will allow universities to continue making loans to current qualified borrowers.\n\nWhile an extension of NACIQI was inserted in the CR, ACSFA, which helped to shape federal student aid policy, also expired on September 30.  This policy committee advised Congress and ED for nearly 30 years.  Its final hearing was held on September 11 (see below).\n\nDuring the Senate debate on Perkins Loans legislation, Chairman Alexander reiterated his intent to have a HEA reauthorization bill through his Committee, now by the end of the 2015.  Though unlikely, both the Perkins Loans program and ACSFA could still be resurrected through the HEA reauthorization bill or the federal funding bill Congress must pass when the current CR expires in December.\n\nIn the House, the Committee on Education and the Workforce Chairman John Kline (R-MN) announced in early September he will not seek reelection in 2016. His retirement likely complicates and may delay any final passage of a HEA reauthorization bill.  Nonetheless, in remarks following the announcement, Chairman Kline stated his hopes to complete the reauthorization of Elementary and Secondary Education Act (ESEA) and reform HEA programs. Contenders for the Committee Chair post include Rep. Joe Wilson (R-SC), Rep. Virginia Foxx (R-NC), and Rep. Duncan Hunter (R-CA).\n\nSources and Additional Information:\n\n  *   More information on the Continuing Resolution is available at <a href=""http://thomas.loc.gov/cgi-bin/query/z?c114%3AH.R.719%3A&lt;http://lewis-burke.us7.list-manage1.com/track/click?u=f246243be672c4f61c7cf29d2&amp;id=c3098ce7b9&amp;e=1b77b1c4fe"">http://thomas.loc.gov/cgi-bin/query/z?c114%3AH.R.719%3A&lt;http://lewis-burke.us7.list-manage1.com/track/click?u=f246243be672c4f61c7cf29d2&amp;id=c3098ce7b9&amp;e=1b77b1c4fe</a>&gt;.\n\nHouse Education and the Workforce Committee Holds Hearing on Campus Sexual Assault\nOn September 10, the House Committee on Education and the Workforce Subcommittee on Higher Education and Workforce Training held a hearing titled ""Preventing and Responding to Sexual Assault on College Campuses.""  This was the first hearing the House has held on campus sexual assault in the 114th Congress and was well-attended by Subcommittee Members on both sides of the aisle. The hearing served as an opportunity for witnesses to describe current challenges campuses face in addressing sexual assault, as well as discuss promising steps institutions can take to begin improving campus climates.\n\nThe hearing joined together many similar perspectives, however, witnesses disagreed as to what role a university ought to play in investigating and adjudicating incidents of sexual assault.  While some felt that all instances of reported sexual assaults should be immediately turned over to local law enforcement, others expressed the importance of letting the victim decide whether or not to report an assault.\n\nSubcommittee Members were interested in whether compliance requirements detracted universities from acting in the students\xe2\x80\x99 best interests.  Witnesses generally agreed that compliance requirements were daunting, and also noted that many current policies, at both the state and federal levels, contradict each other and make it impossible for an institution of higher education to be fully in compliance with all laws at one time.  Members of the Subcommittee were also interested in learning about best practices and promising suggestions the higher education community had for preventing sexual assaults.  Witnesses explained that campus climate surveys, bystander intervention training, social norms training, and healthy relationship workshops have shown promising results on some campuses, but more research must be conducted in this field.\n\nWhile pending sexual assault legislation, such as the Campus Safety and Accountability Act (CASA), the Hold Accountable and Lend Transparency Act (HALT), and the Safe Campus Act (SCA), were referenced throughout the hearing, Congress will likely address the issue of campus sexual assault through the upcoming reauthorization of HEA, rather than through a standalone bill.\n\nSources and Additional Information:\n\n  *   More information on the hearing, including an archived webcast and links to witness testimony, is available at <a href=""http://edworkforce.house.gov/calendar/eventsingle.aspx?EventID=399274&lt;http://lewis-burke.us7.list-manage.com/track/click?u=f246243be672c4f61c7cf29d2&amp;id=cbe67c7e33&amp;e=1b77b1c4fe"">http://edworkforce.house.gov/calendar/eventsingle.aspx?EventID=399274&lt;http://lewis-burke.us7.list-manage.com/track/click?u=f246243be672c4f61c7cf29d2&amp;id=cbe67c7e33&amp;e=1b77b1c4fe</a>&gt;.\n\nSenate Homeland Security and Governmental Affairs Committee Holds Hearing on the Department of Education\nOn September 30, the Senate Homeland Security and Governmental Affairs Committee (HSGAC) held a hearing titled \xe2\x80\x9cA Review of the Department of Education and Student Achievement.\xe2\x80\x9d   HSGAC Chairman, Senator Ron Johnson (R-WI) noted in his opening remarks that the Committee is in the process of reviewing all agencies of the government.  It is interested in reviewing the goals, metrics, and consequences of department actions; this particular hearing focused on ED.   The hearing featured three witnesses in two panels.  The first panel included Kevin Carey, Director, Education Policy Program, New America Foundation; and Richard Vedder, Ph.D., Director, Center for College Affordability and Productivity.  The second panel featured Ted Mitchell, Under Secretary, Department of Education.\n\nWitnesses on the first panel spoke broadly about issues in higher education, including student loan debt, rising college costs, the complexity of the FAFSA, accreditation issues, online education, and Pell grants.  Under Secretary Mitchell\xe2\x80\x99s testimony focused on ED priorities, including access and transparency, affordability and accountability, and innovation.  In general, Members were interested in understanding the rise in college costs and determining ways to measure student learning and career readiness.  Members of each panel discussed sexual assault, with questions by Senator Claire McCaskill (D-MO), who has led Congressional efforts to pass legislation addressing campus sexual assault.\n\nSources and Additional Information:\n\n  *   More information on the hearing, including witness testimony and an archived webcast, is available at <a href=""http://www.hsgac.senate.gov/hearings/a-review-of-the-department-of-education-and-student-achievement&lt;http://lewis-burke.us7.list-manage.com/track/click?u=f246243be672c4f61c7cf29d2&amp;id=ddeb1d9d56&amp;e=1b77b1c4fe"">http://www.hsgac.senate.gov/hearings/a-review-of-the-department-of-education-and-student-achievement&lt;http://lewis-burke.us7.list-manage.com/track/click?u=f246243be672c4f61c7cf29d2&amp;id=ddeb1d9d56&amp;e=1b77b1c4fe</a>&gt;.\n\nJoint Economic Committee Holds Hearing on Financing Higher Education\nOn September 30, the United States Congress Joint Economic Committee held a hearing on \xe2\x80\x9cFinancing Higher Education: Exploring Current Challenges and Potential Alternatives.\xe2\x80\x9d The hearing centered on the economic impacts of issues relating to the HEA reauthorization including the benefits of income-share agreements; the sunsetting of Perkins loans; state disinvestment in higher education; institutional risk-sharing; graduate student versus undergraduate student debt; and the benefits and disadvantages of public and private loans.\n\nThe hearing was well attended by Democratic and Republican House and Senate members-alike.  Members and witnesses addressed many issues that have been discussed frequently by the education committees this Congress, honing in on the economic impacts to both students and taxpayers.

Suzanne Bonamici (D-OR) released draft legislation, the Campus Litigation Privacy Act, on September 17.  This bill would modify portions of the Family Educational Rights and Privacy Act (FERPA) in order to address concerns over gaps in the privacy protections of student medical records.  The legislation aims to narrow the conditions under which an institution can access a student\xe2\x80\x99s medical health records and align with the regulations defined under Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act (HIPAA).  The legislation would also codify recent ED guidance on student medical record disclosure.\n\nSources and Additional Information:\n\n  *   Further details on the draft Campus Litigation Privacy Act can be found at <a href=""https://bonamici.house.gov/press-release/wyden-bonamici-release-draft-bill-protect-student-privacy&lt;http://lewis-burke.us7.list-manage2.com/track/click?u=f246243be672c4f61c7cf29d2&amp;id=f38119df36&amp;e=1b77b1c4fe"">https://bonamici.house.gov/press-release/wyden-bonamici-release-draft-bill-protect-student-privacy&lt;http://lewis-burke.us7.list-manage2.com/track/click?u=f246243be672c4f61c7cf29d2&amp;id=f38119df36&amp;e=1b77b1c4fe</a>&gt;.\n  *   Senator Wyden and Rep.

This new College Scorecard is the Administration\xe2\x80\x99s response to concerns from the higher education community and beyond over its earlier proposal to release a Postsecondary Institutional Ratings System (PIRS).  The College Scorecard is largely an update of the original College Scorecard previously introduced by the Administration, and looks at several expanded measures of student outcomes such as loan repayment rates, median earnings data, and graduation rates.  Some higher education associations have criticized the Scorecard for relying on incomplete datasets, but ED has indicated that it will continue to evolve this tool and identify priority metrics based on institutional concerns and consumer needs.\n\nSources and Additional Information:\n\n  *   The new College Scorecard is available at <a href=""https://collegescorecard.ed.gov/&lt;http://lewis-burke.us7.list-manage.com/track/click?u=f246243be672c4f61c7cf29d2&amp;id=d95e23d34e&amp;e=1b77b1c4fe"">https://collegescorecard.ed.gov/&lt;http://lewis-burke.us7.list-manage.com/track/click?u=f246243be672c4f61c7cf29d2&amp;id=d95e23d34e&amp;e=1b77b1c4fe</a>&gt;.\n  *   More information on the data used and intent of the new College Scorecard can be found at <a href=""http://ow.ly/SWRMQ&lt;http://lewis-burke.us7.list-manage1.com/track/click?u=f246243be672c4f61c7cf29d2&amp;id=4f3aef207a&amp;e=1b77b1c4fe"">http://ow.ly/SWRMQ&lt;http://lewis-burke.us7.list-manage1.com/track/click?u=f246243be672c4f61c7cf29d2&amp;id=4f3aef207a&amp;e=1b77b1c4fe</a>&gt;.\n  *   The White House Fact Sheet is available at <a href=""https://www.whitehouse.gov/the-press-office/2015/09/12/fact-sheet-empowering-students-choose-college-right-them&lt;http://lewis-burke.us7.list-manage.com/track/click?u=f246243be672c4f61c7cf29d2&amp;id=dc5a960b3a&amp;e=1b77b1c4fe"">https://www.whitehouse.gov/the-press-office/2015/09/12/fact-sheet-empowering-students-choose-college-right-them&lt;http://lewis-burke.us7.list-manage.com/track/click?u=f246243be672c4f61c7cf29d2&amp;id=dc5a960b3a&amp;e=1b77b1c4fe</a>&gt;.\n\nDepartment of Education Announces Earlier FAFSA Application; Recommendations for FAFSA Simplification\nOn September 13, the White House announced that beginning in fall of 2016, ED will permit students to fill out the Free Application for Federal Student Aid (FAFSA) earlier than it is currently available.  As early as October 1, 2016, students may file their FAFSA for the following academic year using prior-year income tax information from the Internal Revenue Service (IRS).  By allowing students and families to use the prior, prior-year\xe2\x80\x99s tax data and moving the FAFSA application submission up by several months, this proposal would provide students and families with an earlier indication of college costs.  The change is expected to reduce the burden on campus financial aid offices and provide more opportunities to counsel students on their aid packages.\n\n Sources and Additional Information:\n\n  *   The White House Fact Sheet on Early Financial Aid is available at <a href=""https://www.whitehouse.gov/the-press-office/2015/09/14/fact-sheet-president%E2%80%99s-plan-early-financial-aid-improving-college-choice&lt;http://lewis-burke.us7.list-manage.com/track/click?u=f246243be672c4f61c7cf29d2&amp;id=b7d1267b8f&amp;e=1b77b1c4fe"">https://www.whitehouse.gov/the-press-office/2015/09/14/fact-sheet-president%E2%80%99s-plan-early-financial-aid-improving-college-choice&lt;http://lewis-burke.us7.list-manage.com/track/click?u=f246243be672c4f61c7cf29d2&amp;id=b7d1267b8f&amp;e=1b77b1c4fe</a>&gt;.\n  *   Additional information on the FAFSA changes are available on the Financial Aid toolkit at www.FinancialAidToolkit.ed.gov/fafsa-changes&lt;<a href=""http://lewis-burke.us7.list-manage.com/track/click?u=f246243be672c4f61c7cf29d2&amp;id=6efc919702&amp;e=1b77b1c4fe"">http://lewis-burke.us7.list-manage.com/track/click?u=f246243be672c4f61c7cf29d2&amp;id=6efc919702&amp;e=1b77b1c4fe</a>&gt;.\n\nDepartment of Education Releases New Report on Student Borrower Protections\nOn October 1, ED released a new report highlighting the Administration\xe2\x80\x99s recommendations for statutory and regulatory changes to protect student loan borrowers.

The Senate voted 78-20 on a \xe2\x80\x9cclean\xe2\x80\x9d CR, which did not include a provision to defund Planned Parenthood for which some Republican members had advocated, and the House voted 277-151, with 91 Republicans joining 186 Democrats to pass the final bill.  All federal agencies, programs, and projects will be funded at FY 2015 levels, except for a 0.2 percent across-the-board cut to adhere to statutory spending caps.  The CR also prohibits the start of any new projects or activities proposed in the FY 2016 budget.  An extension of the authorization of the Department of Education\xe2\x80\x99s (ED) National Advisory Committee on Institutional Quality and Integrity (NACIQI) was included in the temporary funding measure.\n\nWashington\xe2\x80\x99s attention has also been focused on Speaker of the House John Boehner (R-OH) who announced his retirement on September 25. The House is expected to hold elections for a replacement on October 8.  The leading candidate for the position is Rep. Kevin McCarthy (R-CA).\n\nOn October 2, the White House announced another leadership change with U.S. Secretary of Education Arne Duncan leaving the Department of Education at the end of December.  Secretary Duncan has served in this leadership role since President Obama took office in 2009.  John B. King, Jr., Senior Advisor Delegated Duties of Deputy Secretary of Education, is expected to serve as the interim secretary.\n\nIN THIS ISSUE\n\nCONGRESSIONAL UPDATES AND NEWS\nHigher Education Act, Perkins Loan Program, and Advisory Committee on Student Financial Assistance Expire\nHouse Education and the Workforce Committee Holds Hearing on Campus Sexual Assault\nSenate Homeland Security and Government Affairs Committee Holds Hearing on the Department of Education\nJoint Economic Committee Holds Hearing on Financing Higher Education\nEducation Coalitions Submit Community Letter Opposing IES Funding Cuts\nCongress Pushes to Modify FERPA for Student Medical Records\n\nFEDERAL AGENCY AND ADMINISTRATION UPDATES AND NEWS\nAdvisory Committee on Student Financial Assistance Holds Hearing\nWhite House Task Force to Protect Students from Sexual Assault Releases Resources\nAdministration Unveils New College Scorecard\nDepartment of Education Announces Earlier FAFSA Application; Recommendations for FAFSA Simplification\nDepartment of Education Releases New Report on Student Borrower Protections\n\n________________________________\nCONGRESSIONAL UPDATES AND NEWS\nHigher Education Act, Perkins Loan Program, and Advisory Committee on Student Financial Assistance Expire\nThe end of the fiscal year marked the expiration of the Higher Education Act (HEA) authorization; though the vast majority of activities under HEA can operate without a current authorization.  The Federal Perkins Loan Program, however, as well as the Advisory Committee on Student Financial Assistance (ACSFA), and NACIQI all required authorization extensions.\n\nDespite a late push for revival, the Perkins Loan program expired at midnight on September 30.  The program, which provided low-interest loans to college students with high financial need, was nearly saved by a bipartisan reauthorization bill that sailed through the House earlier this week.  This effort was ultimately blocked in the Senate, due largely to opposition from Senate Health, Education, Labor and Pensions Committee Chairman Lamar Alexander (R-TN).  Although institutions have lost the authority to authorize new Perkins loans, grandfathering provisions will allow universities to continue making loans to current qualified borrowers.\n\nWhile an extension of NACIQI was inserted in the CR, ACSFA, which helped to shape federal student aid policy, also expired on September 30.  This policy committee advised Congress and ED for nearly 30 years.  Its final hearing was held on September 11 (see below).\n\nDuring the Senate debate on Perkins Loans legislation, Chairman Alexander reiterated his intent to have a HEA reauthorization bill through his Committee, now by the end of the 2015.  Though unlikely, both the Perkins Loans program and ACSFA could still be resurrected through the HEA reauthorization bill or the federal funding bill Congress must pass when the current CR expires in December.\n\nIn the House, the Committee on Education and the Workforce Chairman John Kline (R-MN) announced in early September he will not seek reelection in 2016. His retirement likely complicates and may delay any final passage of a HEA reauthorization bill.  Nonetheless, in remarks following the announcement, Chairman Kline stated his hopes to complete the reauthorization of Elementary and Secondary Education Act (ESEA) and reform HEA programs. Contenders for the Committee Chair post include Rep. Joe Wilson (R-SC), Rep. Virginia Foxx (R-NC), and Rep. Duncan Hunter (R-CA).\n\nSources and Additional Information:\n\n  *   More information on the Continuing Resolution is available at http://thomas.loc.gov/cgi-bin/query/z?c114%3AH.R.719%3A<http://lewis-burke.us7.list-manage1.com/track/click?u=f246243be672c4f61c7cf29d2&id=c3098ce7b9&e=1b77b1c4fe>.\n\nHouse Education and the Workforce Committee Holds Hearing on Campus Sexual Assault\nOn September 10, the House Committee on Education and the Workforce Subcommittee on Higher Education and Workforce Training held a hearing titled ""Preventing and Responding to Sexual Assault on College Campuses.""  This was the first hearing the House has held on campus sexual assault in the 114th Congress and was well-attended by Subcommittee Members on both sides of the aisle. The hearing served as an opportunity for witnesses to describe current challenges campuses face in addressing sexual assault, as well as discuss promising steps institutions can take to begin improving campus climates.\n\nThe hearing joined together many similar perspectives, however, witnesses disagreed as to what role a university ought to play in investigating and adjudicating incidents of sexual assault.  While some felt that all instances of reported sexual assaults should be immediately turned over to local law enforcement, others expressed the importance of letting the victim decide whether or not to report an assault.\n\nSubcommittee Members were interested in whether compliance requirements detracted universities from acting in the students\xe2\x80\x99 best interests.  Witnesses generally agreed that compliance requirements were daunting, and also noted that many current policies, at both the state and federal levels, contradict each other and make it impossible for an institution of higher education to be fully in compliance with all laws at one time.  Members of the Subcommittee were also interested in learning about best practices and promising suggestions the higher education community had for preventing sexual assaults.  Witnesses explained that campus climate surveys, bystander intervention training, social norms training, and healthy relationship workshops have shown promising results on some campuses, but more research must be conducted in this field.\n\nWhile pending sexual assault legislation, such as the Campus Safety and Accountability Act (CASA), the Hold Accountable and Lend Transparency Act (HALT), and the Safe Campus Act (SCA), were referenced throughout the hearing, Congress will likely address the issue of campus sexual assault through the upcoming reauthorization of HEA, rather than through a standalone bill.\n\nSources and Additional Information:\n\n  *   More information on the hearing, including an archived webcast and links to witness testimony, is available at http://edworkforce.house.gov/calendar/eventsingle.aspx?EventID=399274<http://lewis-burke.us7.list-manage.com/track/click?u=f246243be672c4f61c7cf29d2&id=cbe67c7e33&e=1b77b1c4fe>.\n\nSenate Homeland Security and Governmental Affairs Committee Holds Hearing on the Department of Education\nOn September 30, the Senate Homeland Security and Governmental Affairs Committee (HSGAC) held a hearing titled \xe2\x80\x9cA Review of the Department of Education and Student Achievement.\xe2\x80\x9d   HSGAC Chairman, Senator Ron Johnson (R-WI) noted in his opening remarks that the Committee is in the process of reviewing all agencies of the government.  It is interested in reviewing the goals, metrics, and consequences of department actions; this particular hearing focused on ED.   The hearing featured three witnesses in two panels.  The first panel included Kevin Carey, Director, Education Policy Program, New America Foundation; and Richard Vedder, Ph.D., Director, Center for College Affordability and Productivity.  The second panel featured Ted Mitchell, Under Secretary, Department of Education.\n\nWitnesses on the first panel spoke broadly about issues in higher education, including student loan debt, rising college costs, the complexity of the FAFSA, accreditation issues, online education, and Pell grants.  Under Secretary Mitchell\xe2\x80\x99s testimony focused on ED priorities, including access and transparency, affordability and accountability, and innovation.  In general, Members were interested in understanding the rise in college costs and determining ways to measure student learning and career readiness.  Members of each panel discussed sexual assault, with questions by Senator Claire McCaskill (D-MO), who has led Congressional efforts to pass legislation addressing campus sexual assault.\n\nSources and Additional Information:\n\n  *   More information on the hearing, including witness testimony and an archived webcast, is available at http://www.hsgac.senate.gov/hearings/a-review-of-the-department-of-education-and-student-achievement<http://lewis-burke.us7.list-manage.com/track/click?u=f246243be672c4f61c7cf29d2&id=ddeb1d9d56&e=1b77b1c4fe>.\n\nJoint Economic Committee Holds Hearing on Financing Higher Education\nOn September 30, the United States Congress Joint Economic Committee held a hearing on \xe2\x80\x9cFinancing Higher Education: Exploring Current Challenges and Potential Alternatives.\xe2\x80\x9d The hearing centered on the economic impacts of issues relating to the HEA reauthorization including the benefits of income-share agreements; the sunsetting of Perkins loans; state disinvestment in higher education; institutional risk-sharing; graduate student versus undergraduate student debt; and the benefits and disadvantages of public and private loans.\n\nThe hearing was well attended by Democratic and Republican House and Senate members-alike.  Members and witnesses addressed many issues that have been discussed frequently by the education committees this Congress, honing in on the economic impacts to both students and taxpayers.  Chairman Dan Coats (R-IN) calling for greater accountability and transparency, led the hearing.  Ranking Member Carolyn Maloney (D-NY) discussed the burden of student loan debt on young people and implications of the Great Recession on postsecondary attendance and college cost.  Witnesses included Mitch Daniels, President, Purdue University; Dr. Andrew Kelly, Resident Scholar and Director, American Enterprise Institute; and Rohit Chopra, Senior Fellow, Center for American Progress.\n\nSources and Additional Information:\n\n  *   More information on the hearing, including witness testimony and an archived webcast, is available at http://www.jec.senate.gov/public/index.cfm/hearings-calendar?ID=7C64D2C3-1A88-423F-86E0-D524721C4AE2<http://lewis-burke.us7.list-manage.com/track/click?u=f246243be672c4f61c7cf29d2&id=2eda748a36&e=1b77b1c4fe>.\n\nEducation Coalitions Submit Community Letter Opposing IES Funding Cuts\nOn September 10, the Learning and Education Academic Research Network (LEARN) Coalition, a group of colleges of education from leading research institutions, along with the American Educational Research Association (AERA) submitted a letter to the Chair and Ranking Member of the House Appropriations Committee opposing cuts to the Institute of Education Sciences (IES) that were proposed in the FY 2016 Labor, Health and Human Services, and Education Committee-passed appropriations bill.  The letter details the impact the proposed cuts would have on conducting research, measuring academic outcomes, and improving student achievement.

Suzanne Bonamici (D-OR) released draft legislation, the Campus Litigation Privacy Act, on September 17.  This bill would modify portions of the Family Educational Rights and Privacy Act (FERPA) in order to address concerns over gaps in the privacy protections of student medical records.  The legislation aims to narrow the conditions under which an institution can access a student\xe2\x80\x99s medical health records and align with the regulations defined under Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act (HIPAA).  The legislation would also codify recent ED guidance on student medical record disclosure.\n\nSources and Additional Information:\n\n  *   Further details on the draft Campus Litigation Privacy Act can be found at https://bonamici.house.gov/press-release/wyden-bonamici-release-draft-bill-protect-student-privacy<http://lewis-burke.us7.list-manage2.com/track/click?u=f246243be672c4f61c7cf29d2&id=f38119df36&e=1b77b1c4fe>.\n  *   Senator Wyden and Rep.

The first is a \xe2\x80\x9cResource Guide,\xe2\x80\x9d which includes materials and additional information on campus climate surveys, prevention tools, training and technical assistance, sexual misconduct policies and procedures, community partnerships and memoranda of understanding, public awareness and engagement initiatives, data and information-sharing, selected funding opportunities, and related law and policy sources.  The second resource is a toolkit developed by ED\xe2\x80\x99s National Center on Safe Supportive Learning Environments Technical Assistance Center titled \xe2\x80\x9cSafe Place: Trauma-Sensitive Practice for Health Centers Serving Students.\xe2\x80\x9d\n\nSources and Additional Information:\n\n  *   Information on the Task Force\xe2\x80\x99s new resources is available at http://blog.ed.gov/2015/09/task-force-continues-its-work-to-improve-sexual-assault-prevention-and-response/<http://lewis-burke.us7.list-manage2.com/track/click?u=f246243be672c4f61c7cf29d2&id=d17a37d32b&e=1b77b1c4fe>.\n\nAdministration Unveils New College Scorecard\nOn September 12, the Obama Administration released its long-awaited college information tool intended to increase transparency and consumer information about college costs and institutional quality.  This new College Scorecard is the Administration\xe2\x80\x99s response to concerns from the higher education community and beyond over its earlier proposal to release a Postsecondary Institutional Ratings System (PIRS).  The College Scorecard is largely an update of the original College Scorecard previously introduced by the Administration, and looks at several expanded measures of student outcomes such as loan repayment rates, median earnings data, and graduation rates.  Some higher education associations have criticized the Scorecard for relying on incomplete datasets, but ED has indicated that it will continue to evolve this tool and identify priority metrics based on institutional concerns and consumer needs.\n\nSources and Additional Information:\n\n  *   The new College Scorecard is available at https://collegescorecard.ed.gov/<http://lewis-burke.us7.list-manage.com/track/click?u=f246243be672c4f61c7cf29d2&id=d95e23d34e&e=1b77b1c4fe>.\n  *   More information on the data used and intent of the new College Scorecard can be found at http://ow.ly/SWRMQ<http://lewis-burke.us7.list-manage1.com/track/click?u=f246243be672c4f61c7cf29d2&id=4f3aef207a&e=1b77b1c4fe>.\n  *   The White House Fact Sheet is available at https://www.whitehouse.gov/the-press-office/2015/09/12/fact-sheet-empowering-students-choose-college-right-them<http://lewis-burke.us7.list-manage.com/track/click?u=f246243be672c4f61c7cf29d2&id=dc5a960b3a&e=1b77b1c4fe>.\n\nDepartment of Education Announces Earlier FAFSA Application; Recommendations for FAFSA Simplification\nOn September 13, the White House announced that beginning in fall of 2016, ED will permit students to fill out the Free Application for Federal Student Aid (FAFSA) earlier than it is currently available.  As early as October 1, 2016, students may file their FAFSA for the following academic year using prior-year income tax information from the Internal Revenue Service (IRS).  By allowing students and families to use the prior, prior-year\xe2\x80\x99s tax data and moving the FAFSA application submission up by several months, this proposal would provide students and families with an earlier indication of college costs.  The change is expected to reduce the burden on campus financial aid offices and provide more opportunities to counsel students on their aid packages.\n\n Sources and Additional Information:\n\n  *   The White House Fact Sheet on Early Financial Aid is available at https://www.whitehouse.gov/the-press-office/2015/09/14/fact-sheet-president%E2%80%99s-plan-early-financial-aid-improving-college-choice<http://lewis-burke.us7.list-manage.com/track/click?u=f246243be672c4f61c7cf29d2&id=b7d1267b8f&e=1b77b1c4fe>.\n  *   Additional information on the FAFSA changes are available on the Financial Aid toolkit at www.FinancialAidToolkit.ed.gov/fafsa-changes<http://lewis-burke.us7.list-manage.com/track/click?u=f246243be672c4f61c7cf29d2&id=6efc919702&e=1b77b1c4fe>.\n\nDepartment of Education Releases New Report on Student Borrower Protections\nOn October 1, ED released a new report highlighting the Administration\xe2\x80\x99s recommendations for statutory and regulatory changes to protect student loan borrowers.

Many of us saw personally the shock and sadness that you experienced last week due to having friends at UCC, being from the Roseburg area, or being affected as all of us were by the mere thought of such a tragedy. While there has been an outpouring of support for you from both near and far, we know that the recovery process will be long for some of you; occurring sometime after the headlines fade.\n\nKrista Chronister, our Assistant Dean for Equity and Inclusion, has been at the forefront of our efforts to assist you. She will continue to coordinate our college-wide efforts to help you recover, and link you to university resources. For example, I advise you to contact the University Counseling Center&lt;<a href=""http://counseling.uoregon.edu/"">http://counseling.uoregon.edu/</a>&gt;, where counselors are available and ready to talk at 1590 East 13th Avenue (across from Oregon Hall), or by calling the center at 541-346-3227. Our faculty and staff can reach counselors through the employee assistance program by calling 1-800-433-2320.\n\nFinally, I have attached information about the vigil that will be held this evening, October 5 at 7pm.

I also want to acknowledge Lisa Fortin, our events coordinator, for putting together this event on such short notice, and our Student Diversity Advisory Board and Dean\'s Student Advisory Board for their attendance. As expected, I learned a great deal from my conversations with so many of you, and I appreciated your listening attentively. As I expressed to you then, I am fully aware that our work to create an inclusive and equitable learning environment in the college will require long term commitment and the efforts of many.\n\n\n\nAs I mentioned to some of you, we have at least begun the work. Listed below are some of the efforts we have made in the past year to begin to move our college toward the dual goals of improving inclusion and equity.\n\n\n\nWe created an Assistant Dean for Equity and Inclusion position this summer.  Dr. Krista Chronister serves in this role at .40 FTE (Full Time Equivalent), and her charge is to support the intellectual and civic excellence of our students, faculty, and staff by helping to establish equitable and inclusive practices across our instructional, training, service, and research activities.\n\nIn collaboration with our Student Diversity Affairs Committee (SDAC), we administered a College student survey last spring to assess the quality of students\' learning experiences.\n\nWe now have a student, staff, and faculty representative to the UO Diversity Committee.  Each representative reports back to Krista.\n\nWe meet quarterly with the Dean\'s Student Advisory Board to hear from students about their experiences and needs as well as to share College information.\n\nWe maintain a College Diversity Advisory Committee comprised of community members specializing in education and social services.\n\nWe formed new collaborative partnerships with UO and local community groups to foster the post-secondary development of youth in our community and connection between College of Education students and community leaders.\n\nWe maintain an active Student Diversity Affairs Committee and support this committee formally with a GTF (Graduate Teaching Fellow position). SDAC and the GTF are supervised by Krista.\n\nWe started the Our Space art initiative. The purpose of Our Space is to bring into our College learning spaces artwork that reflects the diversity of our College student community and the diversity of the children and families our graduates will serve.\n\nWe collaborated with United Academics and Academic Affairs to offer two new faculty mentoring initiatives that aim to increase retention of faculty from traditionally underrepresented groups in higher education.\n\nWe are devoting much time and collaborative energy to creating a plan that meets the requirements of House Bill 3375; a plan to articulate how the College will increase recruitment, retention and graduation rates of UO domestic minority education personnel.\n\nI also heard you and your colleagues across campus ask for more participation in the faculty hiring process. We began this Fall by routinely including both a student and staff member on every new faculty search committee. But, I am well aware that one of your central goals for us is to create a workforce of faculty and staff that better reflects our local, national, and international leadership aspirations. We did make some progress last year (See our new faculty hires at : <a href=""https://education.uoregon.edu/office-dean/new-faculty-2015-16"">https://education.uoregon.edu/office-dean/new-faculty-2015-16</a>) by hiring new faculty that meet the highest standards of academic excellence.

The actions of a few are taken to be indications of the character of most, creating an atmosphere of threat and intimidation for Muslim citizens throughout the West.  Recent highly publicized comments by national political figures have intensified this atmosphere of threat and intimidation in the United States.  Assaults against citizens believed to be Muslim has risen lately.  And reports of unkind and bigoted remarks are increasing.  This is having effects on the daily experiences of our Muslim colleagues, students, and community members as well as anyone presumed to be Muslim.\n To our Muslim colleagues we say: Although we cannot change the national and international discourse, we can make clear that the voices of hate do not speak for us.  On behalf of the Education Studies faculty and staff, we want to state clearly our solidarity with our Muslim colleagues and students, their families, and their community.  We stand with you against this hate and bigotry.  When you walk in our door we see good people whom we want to know and with whom we want to work.\n For individual faculty and staff who are looking for a way to signal this solidarity, some of us will be posting fliers on our doors that say \xe2\x80\x9cAs-salamu alaykum\xe2\x80\x9d which translates roughly to \xe2\x80\x9cpeace be upon you.\xe2\x80\x9d  It is a greeting regularly used in Muslim gatherings.

First, we wanted to bring in the best candidates on the job market this year in this topic area.  Next, we wanted to recruit faculty whose research was synergistic with our strengths in the College of Education and participating departments/units.  Last, we wanted to make sure the group would form a true \xe2\x80\x9ccluster\xe2\x80\x9d,  with research interests that were related to each other in order to promote future collaboration.

Fifteen courses were reviewed by the COE Curriculum Committee.  One course was deactivated (CDS Audiological Rehabilitation). One course was sent back for revisions and all others were approved by faculty. These were moved forward to UOCC. Just a reminder you can track the status of any course by looking it up in CourseLeaf (<a href=""https://nextcatalog.uoregon.edu/courseadmin/"">https://nextcatalog.uoregon.edu/courseadmin/</a> ).\n\nAbout 50% of the courses needed to have some adjustments to them before going forward to the COE Curriculum Committee.  A large number of these were because faculty are not using the most current syllabi template.  We had syllabi that clearly had not been updated as they included contacts such as David Chard and Joe Stevens, much less statements and links that were out of date. Please look at all your syllabi and be sure to update each year.

There have been a few glitches in process but overall went smoothly. The Curriculum Committee will look at the process to see if any changes need to be made internally due to this management system. I am continuing to meet with Ron Bramhall and Kathy Warden to better manage our system and to address faculty concerns regarding the visibility of comments and voting. I will keep you posted as I learn more.\n\nProgram review. Four programs were reviewed by the COE Curriculum Committee: Family and Human Services Minor, Quantitative Research Methods Graduate Specialization, Educational Foundations: Secondary Undergraduate Certificate, Foundations in Special Education Undergraduate Certificate.  All were approved by the faculty and have moved forward to Academic Affairs and the Graduate School (where appropriate).\n\nHigher Education Administration Graduate Specialization which was approved last year by faculty.

The first step in developing a new program is approval of a synopsis by the Department Head Council and Dean (meet about 2x per month). Things to consider for the synopsis are:\n\n1.

RSVP using the link below.  Space is limited and food is provided.\n\n\nCollege of Education Workshop: Managing Hot Moments in the Classroom\n\nMany instructors avoid controversial topics in the classroom because of the difficulty involved in managing heated discussions.  Instructors who are willing to bring up such issues may face disheartening challenges in the classroom or low student ratings, in part, because of their identity-their race, gender, accent, etc.  Controversy can be a useful, powerful, and memorable tool to promote learning.  Research has demonstrated that conflict or controversy during classroom discussion can promote cognitive gains in complex reasoning, integrated thinking, and decision-making.  During this workshop we will discuss how instructors can successfully manage discussions on controversial topics.  Participants will consider problematic scenarios and discuss approaches to avoid problems.\n\nWorkshop Leader:  Dr. Joan Middendorf, Center for Innovative Teaching and Learning and Educational Leadership, Indiana University\nVenue:  ED 176\nDate:  Monday, February 8\nTime:  2:00pm - 3:30pm\nRSVP:  Space is limited.

Girvan, J.D., Ph.D., UO School of Law\n\nHow can someone\'s race, sex, age, or other characteristics influence how we see and treat them even when we are genuinely trying to be unbiased? What concrete steps can we take to help prevent this from happening? To help answer these questions, this workshop introduces the concept of implicit bias. Through a mix of short presentations, lively activities, and discussions, we will explore some harmful side effects of how our brains naturally perceive, categorize, and draw inferences about the world, including other people. We will also examine when this kind of bias is most likely to occur. And we will talk about what practical steps we can all take to try to reduce or eliminate it as well as what has been shown not to work.\n\n\nImplicit Bias in Decision-Making: Specific Applications\nTuesday, February 16th | Noon -12:30 p.m.\nKnight Library Browsing Room\nWorkshop conducted by Erik J. Girvan, J.D., Ph.D., UO School of Law\n\nKnowing about implicit biases is not enough to reduce it or keep it from impacting what we do. Building on the introduction to implicit bias, in this workshop participants will work with the presenters to identify specific policies and practices in their workplace that are most likely to be affected by implicit bias and brainstorm concrete changes that they can make to minimize those effects.\n\n\nPlease join us!\n\n\n\n\n\n[Sylvio\'s]\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSpace is limited.

The course focuses on the intersection of media, education, and technology, with specific emphasis on digital storytelling and interview methods. It explores personal and professional narratives surrounding education through critique\nof societal notions and media representations about teaching, student achievement, and education reform.

This course interrogates adult-centered representations of youth, their problems, and the supposed solutions to these problems. We explore how adult world constructs and acts on youth through the institutions they control, including law and criminal justice. Concurrently, we investigate how these institutional domains are imagined and acted on by youth, differently situated, bringing to intellectual life a rarely considered youth-centered perspective of social life and activism. Throughout the course, we give attention to histories, tensions, and implications of different ways of thinking about and acting on youth. As a legal studies endeavor, this course encompasses cases, policy and regulations as they are lived, shaped and encountered by youth of different backgrounds. We bring forward ideas about identities, trust, agency and space as well as methodological tools that allow us to understand how youth make sense of their lives, assert their views of justice, fairness, and legality, and act on them as agents of change. To accomplish this, we engage in classroom and field-related learning.\n\nBrigid\n-------------- next part --------------\nAn HTML attachment was scrubbed...\nURL: &lt;<a href=""http://lists-prod.uoregon.edu/pipermail/coe-fac/attachments/20160226/b053e6b6/attachment-0001.html"">http://lists-prod.uoregon.edu/pipermail/coe-fac/attachments/20160226/b053e6b6/attachment-0001.html</a>&gt;\n-------------- next part --------------\nA non-text attachment was scrubbed...\nName: VideoLab_Poster_Small.pdf\nType: application/pdf\nSize: 1576405 bytes\nDesc: VideoLab_Poster_Small.pdf\nURL: &lt;<a href=""http://lists-prod.uoregon.edu/pipermail/coe-fac/attachments/20160226/b053e6b6/attachment-0002.pdf"">http://lists-prod.uoregon.edu/pipermail/coe-fac/attachments/20160226/b053e6b6/attachment-0002.pdf</a>&gt;\n-------------- next part --------------\nA non-text attachment was scrubbed...\nName: Youth and Social Change flyer-Final.pdf\nType: application/pdf\nSize: 358719 bytes\nDesc: Youth and Social Change flyer-Final.pdf\nURL: &lt;<a href=""http://lists-prod.uoregon.edu/pipermail/coe-fac/attachments/20160226/b053e6b6/attachment-0003.pdf"">http://lists-prod.uoregon.edu/pipermail/coe-fac/attachments/20160226/b053e6b6/attachment-0003.pdf</a>&gt;\n</pre>'","b'Faculty there are a couple of new courses offered this spring.

During the hearing, King emphasized that that the actions of ED are guided by three main principles: ensuring every child has the opportunity to receive an excellent education; supporting teachers and elevating the teaching profession; and improving access, affordability, and completion in higher education.\n\nThe hearing was widely attended by Members from both sides of the aisle, alternating praise and criticism for the proposed ED budget.  Chairman John Kline (R-MN) led his party\xe2\x80\x99s opposition to the proposals in the budget request by criticizing the utilization of mandatory funding streams, the creation of new expensive programs, and the perceived underfunding of special education.  Virginia Foxx (R-NC), who is the presumed successor as Chair of the House Ed and Workforce Committee upon Chairman Kline\xe2\x80\x99s retirement, questioned the actions and authority of the Office of Civil Rights at ED.  Other Members touched upon the issues of student loan debt and federal loan interest rates; criticized the College Scorecard; and questioned the regulatory burden placed on colleges and universities.  Representatives Ruben Hinojosa (D-TX) and Raul Grijalva (D-AZ) expressed concern that ED had overlooked Hispanic-Serving Institutions (HSIs) in its budget request.  Other Members lauded ED\xe2\x80\x99s expansion of the Pell Grant program to include year-round Pell Grants, income-driven repayment programs, and targeting Federal Work Study funds to students with the greatest financial need.  The budget request for ED is unlikely to gain traction in Congress due to partisan disagreements and the budget request\xe2\x80\x99s reliance on mandatory funding for new programs.\n\n\nThe following day, King was back on the Hill, this time on the Senate-side. On February 25, the Senate Health, Education, Labor, and Pensions (HELP) Committee held a hearing to examine King\xe2\x80\x99s nomination to serve as Secretary of Education, focusing on implementation of the Every Student Succeeds Act and higher education issues including preventing campus sexual assault; simplifying the financial aid process; and addressing student loan servicing, interest rates, and repayment.  This hearing followed President Obama\xe2\x80\x99s nomination of John King as Secretary of Education on February 11.  King, formerly an Acting Deputy Secretary of Education, has served as Acting Secretary since Arne Duncan stepped down from the post at the end of 2015.  Chairman of the Senate HELP Committee Lamar Alexander (R-TN) encouraged the President to appoint a nominee, and has promised an expedited confirmation hearing.  The Committee will consider the mark-up of King\xe2\x80\x99s nomination on March 9.\n\nSources and Additional Information:\n\n\xc2\xb7         An archived webcast and witness testimony for the hearing on the ED budget request can be found at <a href=""http://edworkforce.house.gov/calendar/eventsingle.aspx?EventID=400263."">http://edworkforce.house.gov/calendar/eventsingle.aspx?EventID=400263.</a>\n\n\xc2\xb7         A full archived webcast and witness testimony for the February 25 hearing on King\xe2\x80\x99s nomination can be found at <a href=""http://www.help.senate.gov/hearings/nomination-of-dr-john-king-to-serve-as-secretary-of-education."">http://www.help.senate.gov/hearings/nomination-of-dr-john-king-to-serve-as-secretary-of-education.</a>\n\n\nLewis-Burke Associates, LLC\n1341 G Street, N.W.\nEighth Floor\nWashington, D.C. 20005\n\n________________________________\nDisclaimer: This message is intended only for the named recipient.

The budget request for ED is unlikely to gain traction in Congress due to partisan disagreements and the budget request\xe2\x80\x99s reliance on mandatory funding for new programs.\n\n\nThe following day, King was back on the Hill, this time on the Senate-side. On February 25, the Senate Health, Education, Labor, and Pensions (HELP) Committee held a hearing to examine King\xe2\x80\x99s nomination to serve as Secretary of Education, focusing on implementation of the Every Student Succeeds Act and higher education issues including preventing campus sexual assault; simplifying the financial aid process; and addressing student loan servicing, interest rates, and repayment.  This hearing followed President Obama\xe2\x80\x99s nomination of John King as Secretary of Education on February 11.  King, formerly an Acting Deputy Secretary of Education, has served as Acting Secretary since Arne Duncan stepped down from the post at the end of 2015.  Chairman of the Senate HELP Committee Lamar Alexander (R-TN) encouraged the President to appoint a nominee, and has promised an expedited confirmation hearing.  The Committee will consider the mark-up of King\xe2\x80\x99s nomination on March 9.\n\nSources and Additional Information:\n\n\xc2\xb7         An archived webcast and witness testimony for the hearing on the ED budget request can be found at http://edworkforce.house.gov/calendar/eventsingle.aspx?EventID=400263.\n\n\xc2\xb7         A full archived webcast and witness testimony for the February 25 hearing on King\xe2\x80\x99s nomination can be found at http://www.help.senate.gov/hearings/nomination-of-dr-john-king-to-serve-as-secretary-of-education.\n\n\nLewis-Burke Associates, LLC\n1341 G Street, N.W.\nEighth Floor\nWashington, D.C. 20005\n\n________________________________\nDisclaimer: This message is intended only for the named recipient.

On Feb. 19, 1942, Franklin D. Roosevelt signed Executive Order 9066&lt;<a href=""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Executive_Order_9066"">https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Executive_Order_9066</a>&gt;, which eventually authorized the forced relocation and incarceration of more than 120,000 Japanese Americans just because they looked like the enemy.  Yasui believed Roosevelt\'s order was unconstitutional.  On March 28 of that year, he deliberately broke the curfew placed on all people of Japanese ancestry under the order and walked at night around Portland, Oregon.

On Feb. 19, 1942, Franklin D. Roosevelt signed Executive Order 9066<https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Executive_Order_9066>, which eventually authorized the forced relocation and incarceration of more than 120,000 Japanese Americans just because they looked like the enemy.  Yasui believed Roosevelt's order was unconstitutional.  On March 28 of that year, he deliberately broke the curfew placed on all people of Japanese ancestry under the order and walked at night around Portland, Oregon.  His case was taken to the U.S. Supreme Court.\nIf you are interested in learning more about this UO Alum, civil rights activist, and recipient of the Presidential Medal of Freedom, there are free copies of the book, Stubborn Twig, available outside the Dean\xe2\x80\x99s Office (130 HEDCO).

The IES Funding Opportunities website also has information about funding webinars.\nThe remaining grant competitions, including those from the National Center for Special Education Research (NCSER), will be announced later this week.\nEducation Research Grants\nThe Education Research Grants focus on outcomes and challenges on a broad range of topics at all levels, including early childhood, elementary, secondary, postsecondary, and adult education. Grants can be funded for up to five years and support many kinds of projects, including exploratory research, development and pilot-testing of new interventions, efficacy and effectiveness studies, and measurement studies. For this year\'s competition, NCER has added three special topics for which it will accept applications:\n\n  *   Arts in Education: Research investigating the relationship between arts participation and education outcomes or the effects of arts programs on education outcomes;\n  *   Career Technical Education (CTE): Research on policies, programs, and practices that are aimed at increasing career readiness in K-12 students. IES is particularly interested in understanding what types of CTE programs work best, for whom, and under what conditions.

The long-term outcome of this research program will be a wide range of methodological and statistical products that will better enable education scientists to conduct rigorous education research.\nFor the FY 2017, there are two topics in this area: Regular Grants and Early Career Grants for researchers who completed their doctorates on or after April 1, 2012.

It\'s because we keep growing at such a fast pace! Since January, we\'ve added seven new Institutional Members and more than 2,700 new faculty, post-docs and graduate students into our community. And of course, as we continue to grow, we keep looking for new ways to support our members and help them grow and become highly productive.\n\nBecause we\xe2\x80\x99re focused on productivity heading into the summer, we\xe2\x80\x99ve got some exciting opportunities for you! First and foremost, the registration for our summer bootcamp (the Faculty Success Program&lt;<a href=""http://www.facultydiversity.org/link.asp?e=kmg@uoregon.edu&amp;job=2365182&amp;ymlink=4836551&amp;finalurl=http%3A%2F%2Fwww%2Efacultydiversity%2Eorg%2F%3FFSProgramDescription"">http://www.facultydiversity.org/link.asp?e=kmg@uoregon.edu&amp;job=2365182&amp;ymlink=4836551&amp;finalurl=http%3A%2F%2Fwww%2Efacultydiversity%2Eorg%2F%3FFSProgramDescription</a>&gt;) has officially opened. Last session we filled up before the end of registration, so don\xe2\x80\x99t wait to register (we\'re already 62% full).\n\nWe also have a great line-up of professional development training this month! Professor Mindi Thompson (University of Wisconsin-Madison) will be teaching our core curriculum webinar on Mastering Academic Time Management&lt;<a href=""http://www.facultydiversity.org/link.asp?e=kmg@uoregon.edu&amp;job=2365182&amp;ymlink=4836551&amp;finalurl=http%3A%2F%2Fwww%2Efacultydiversity%2Eorg%2Fevents%2FEvent%5FDetails%2Easp%3Fid%3D697242%26legacy%3D1"">http://www.facultydiversity.org/link.asp?e=kmg@uoregon.edu&amp;job=2365182&amp;ymlink=4836551&amp;finalurl=http%3A%2F%2Fwww%2Efacultydiversity%2Eorg%2Fevents%2FEvent%5FDetails%2Easp%3Fid%3D697242%26legacy%3D1</a>&gt;, and Professors Cynthia Ganote (Saint Mary\'s College), Floyd Cheung (Smith College), and Tasha Souza (Boise State University) will be offering the last installment of our series on Campus Incivility with a webinar on Micro-Aggressions, Micro-Resistance, and Ally Development in the Academy&lt;<a href=""http://www.facultydiversity.org/link.asp?e=kmg@uoregon.edu&amp;job=2365182&amp;ymlink=4836551&amp;finalurl=http%3A%2F%2Fwww%2Efacultydiversity%2Eorg%2Fevents%2FEvent%5FDetails%2Easp%3Fid%3D749467%26legacy%3D1"">http://www.facultydiversity.org/link.asp?e=kmg@uoregon.edu&amp;job=2365182&amp;ymlink=4836551&amp;finalurl=http%3A%2F%2Fwww%2Efacultydiversity%2Eorg%2Fevents%2FEvent%5FDetails%2Easp%3Fid%3D749467%26legacy%3D1</a>&gt;.\n\n\n[<a href=""https://facultydiversity.site-ym.com/resource/resmgr/Email2/groupphoto496x303.jpg"">https://facultydiversity.site-ym.com/resource/resmgr/Email2/groupphoto496x303.jpg</a>]\n\n\n\nNCFDD Campus Workshop Facilitator Joy Gaston Gayles at the\nRochester Institute of Technology\n\n\n\n\nAdditionally, this month we\'re introducing you to one of our Certified Workshop Facilitators (Professor Joy Gayles, North Carolina State University) who is available to visit your campus.

And of course, as we continue to grow, we keep looking for new ways to support our members and help them grow and become highly productive.\n\nBecause we\xe2\x80\x99re focused on productivity heading into the summer, we\xe2\x80\x99ve got some exciting opportunities for you! First and foremost, the registration for our summer bootcamp (the Faculty Success Program<http://www.facultydiversity.org/link.asp?e=kmg@uoregon.edu&job=2365182&ymlink=4836551&finalurl=http%3A%2F%2Fwww%2Efacultydiversity%2Eorg%2F%3FFSProgramDescription>) has officially opened. Last session we filled up before the end of registration, so don\xe2\x80\x99t wait to register (we're already 62% full).\n\nWe also have a great line-up of professional development training this month! Professor Mindi Thompson (University of Wisconsin-Madison) will be teaching our core curriculum webinar on Mastering Academic Time Management<http://www.facultydiversity.org/link.asp?e=kmg@uoregon.edu&job=2365182&ymlink=4836551&finalurl=http%3A%2F%2Fwww%2Efacultydiversity%2Eorg%2Fevents%2FEvent%5FDetails%2Easp%3Fid%3D697242%26legacy%3D1>, and Professors Cynthia Ganote (Saint Mary's College), Floyd Cheung (Smith College), and Tasha Souza (Boise State University) will be offering the last installment of our series on Campus Incivility with a webinar on Micro-Aggressions, Micro-Resistance, and Ally Development in the Academy<http://www.facultydiversity.org/link.asp?e=kmg@uoregon.edu&job=2365182&ymlink=4836551&finalurl=http%3A%2F%2Fwww%2Efacultydiversity%2Eorg%2Fevents%2FEvent%5FDetails%2Easp%3Fid%3D749467%26legacy%3D1>.\n\n\n[https://facultydiversity.site-ym.com/resource/resmgr/Email2/groupphoto496x303.jpg]\n\n\n\nNCFDD Campus Workshop Facilitator Joy Gaston Gayles at the\nRochester Institute of Technology\n\n\n\n\nAdditionally, this month we're introducing you to one of our Certified Workshop Facilitators (Professor Joy Gayles, North Carolina State University) who is available to visit your campus.

Next year a new CourseLeaf program for management of  programs will be used. As we decided with the system for courses we will comment and vote using the Qualtrics system though all documentation will be in CourseLeaf. I have seen the prototype and it operates similar to the course management system. I will work this summer to get a tip sheet together as we did for course system and host a training at beginning of the fall term.\n\nCourse/Program dates for Fall term: I am in the process of setting these with the COE Curriculum Committee once we have the UOCC dates  - probably due end of October\n\nNew programs in Fall: Early Fall watch for the new minor in Leadership from EMPL.

They will begin the COE/UO approval process in the fall.  This course is the college wide required course for all doctoral students.\n\nEDUC Courses: The course schedule and instructors will be available on the Curriculum Resources webpage. I am in the process of building a 3 year timetable.  All current syllabi are available in PubDocs/EDUC syllabi. We will update this by the end of each term.\n\nIt was discussed at the department head meeting and decided that EDUC Philosophical Foundations of Educational Research will not be offered in 2016-2017. This is still a required course for incoming PhD students so programs should plan on new students taking this required course in 2017-2018. It will be offered each Fall (not winter) and this resulted in changes to the terms the Qual classes are offered.

The UO is still using CourseLeaf. All courses can be reviewed throughout the year through CourseLeaf Management System (<a href=""https://nextcatalog.uoregon.edu/courseadmin/"">https://nextcatalog.uoregon.edu/courseadmin/</a>).\n\nSix courses associated with the Lead minor were reviewed for comment and will come for vote along with the program later in Fall term. Revised courses from EMPL DEd will be reviewed and voted on this fall as well.\n\nThe due date for course submissions for review this Fall are October 21.  I do expect to see the Foundations of Educational Research course for review this Fall. You can check out any of the dates on the calendar in the Curriculum Resources website mentioned above.\n\nDue to the visibility of comments and voting we will continue to use a Qualtrics system for voting.\n\nProgram Review. Three programs will be reviewed this fall. Three are Expedited: Prevention Science MS and PhD Programs (change in number of credits for the program) and EMPL DEd Program (request to offer the program outside of Oregon); CPSY PhD program (change in number of credits for the program). These will be shared during the comment period, but because these are Expedited Programs, they will only be voted on by the COE Curriculum Committee.\n\nThe DEd Program also has a series of courses that will need to be voted on. These are revisions of the courses in their current DEd program, and thus will be the courses for the expanded program. As you are aware, when a program moves to the council, they request that any experimental courses (e.g. 410, 510, 610) go through the process of course approval.\n\nOne program, EMPL minor, will come through as a Full Review. First, you will see it and be allowed to comment. Then after a review by the COE Curriculum Committee, it will come for a COE faculty vote and the six affiliated courses (commented on last spring) will be voted on as well.\n\nThere is work underway on a Board Certified Behavior Analyst (BCBA) Program. This will be a certificate program and it is anticipated it will be submitted during the winter timeline.\n\nNotification about commenting and voting on curriculum will occur through email as the CourseLeaf Management System for Programs is not ready to be released. Again, remember that you share comments with a Committee Member from your department but you vote through a Qualtrics survey that will be sent via email.\n\nTeacher Engagement Program (Aka Teacher Effectiveness Program)\nThe TEP program has redesigned their website and added many resources so I recommend you take a look. <a href=""http://tep.uoregon.edu/"">http://tep.uoregon.edu/</a>\n\nCommon Read\nUO\'s Common Read this year is Ta-Nehisi Coates - Between the World and Me.  There is a website with reading resources, campus resources and teaching resources. <a href=""http://commonreading.uoregon.edu/current-book-btwam/"">http://commonreading.uoregon.edu/current-book-btwam/</a>\n\nThanks for all the work by faculty and staff to improve our programs and courses.

Revised courses from EMPL DEd will be reviewed and voted on this fall as well.\n\nThe due date for course submissions for review this Fall are October 21.  I do expect to see the Foundations of Educational Research course for review this Fall. You can check out any of the dates on the calendar in the Curriculum Resources website mentioned above.\n\nDue to the visibility of comments and voting we will continue to use a Qualtrics system for voting.\n\nProgram Review. Three programs will be reviewed this fall. Three are Expedited: Prevention Science MS and PhD Programs (change in number of credits for the program) and EMPL DEd Program (request to offer the program outside of Oregon); CPSY PhD program (change in number of credits for the program). These will be shared during the comment period, but because these are Expedited Programs, they will only be voted on by the COE Curriculum Committee.\n\nThe DEd Program also has a series of courses that will need to be voted on. These are revisions of the courses in their current DEd program, and thus will be the courses for the expanded program. As you are aware, when a program moves to the council, they request that any experimental courses (e.g. 410, 510, 610) go through the process of course approval.\n\nOne program, EMPL minor, will come through as a Full Review. First, you will see it and be allowed to comment. Then after a review by the COE Curriculum Committee, it will come for a COE faculty vote and the six affiliated courses (commented on last spring) will be voted on as well.\n\nThere is work underway on a Board Certified Behavior Analyst (BCBA) Program. This will be a certificate program and it is anticipated it will be submitted during the winter timeline.\n\nNotification about commenting and voting on curriculum will occur through email as the CourseLeaf Management System for Programs is not ready to be released. Again, remember that you share comments with a Committee Member from your department but you vote through a Qualtrics survey that will be sent via email.\n\nTeacher Engagement Program (Aka Teacher Effectiveness Program)\nThe TEP program has redesigned their website and added many resources so I recommend you take a look. http://tep.uoregon.edu/\n\nCommon Read\nUO\'s Common Read this year is Ta-Nehisi Coates - Between the World and Me.  There is a website with reading resources, campus resources and teaching resources. http://commonreading.uoregon.edu/current-book-btwam/\n\nThanks for all the work by faculty and staff to improve our programs and courses. If you have curriculum questions, check in with your Program Director, Department Head, COE Curriculum Committee representative or schedule a time to meet with me if necessary.\n\nBrigid\n\nK.

Proposals are due November 16, 2016 and should be submitted online&lt;<a href=""https://forms.uoregon.edu/forms/list/Clark%20Honors%20College"">https://forms.uoregon.edu/forms/list/Clark%20Honors%20College</a>&gt;.\n\nThe CHC offers opportunities to teach small groups of highly motivated students with strong academic skills. Students enrolled in the CHC major in a broad range of disciplines on our campus but come together in their Honors College classes to learn and to share their perspectives in the context of a liberal arts and sciences curriculum. Teaching a course at CHC may offer opportunities for interdisciplinarity, as well as for pedagogical experimentation and innovation.\n\nCourse proposals for 200-level introductory courses and 400-level colloquia are welcome from all faculty \xe2\x80\x93 tenured, tenure-related, and NTTF - from across all colleges and fields at UO. Further details on course types are available on the CHC website&lt;<a href=""http://honors.uoregon.edu/content/submit-course-proposal"">http://honors.uoregon.edu/content/submit-course-proposal</a>&gt;. All courses should be designed for a maximum of 19 students in a class, should be relevant for students pursuing various majors, and should encourage critical and creative thinking, writing, reading, and discussion skills.\n\nSubmitting your proposal:\n\nCourse proposals must be submitted via the Clark Honors College Affiliated Faculty Course Proposal&lt;<a href=""https://forms.uoregon.edu/forms/list/Clark%20Honors%20College"">https://forms.uoregon.edu/forms/list/Clark%20Honors%20College</a>&gt; online form. All documents require electronic signatures from your department head - and from your dean if you are a non-CAS faculty member \xe2\x80\x93 and must be submitted by November 16, 2016 at 5pm.

Proposals are due November 16, 2016 and should be submitted online<https://forms.uoregon.edu/forms/list/Clark%20Honors%20College>.\n\nThe CHC offers opportunities to teach small groups of highly motivated students with strong academic skills. Students enrolled in the CHC major in a broad range of disciplines on our campus but come together in their Honors College classes to learn and to share their perspectives in the context of a liberal arts and sciences curriculum. Teaching a course at CHC may offer opportunities for interdisciplinarity, as well as for pedagogical experimentation and innovation.\n\nCourse proposals for 200-level introductory courses and 400-level colloquia are welcome from all faculty \xe2\x80\x93 tenured, tenure-related, and NTTF - from across all colleges and fields at UO. Further details on course types are available on the CHC website<http://honors.uoregon.edu/content/submit-course-proposal>. All courses should be designed for a maximum of 19 students in a class, should be relevant for students pursuing various majors, and should encourage critical and creative thinking, writing, reading, and discussion skills.\n\nSubmitting your proposal:\n\nCourse proposals must be submitted via the Clark Honors College Affiliated Faculty Course Proposal<https://forms.uoregon.edu/forms/list/Clark%20Honors%20College> online form. All documents require electronic signatures from your department head - and from your dean if you are a non-CAS faculty member \xe2\x80\x93 and must be submitted by November 16, 2016 at 5pm. This deadline makes it possible for the CHC Curriculum Committee to review proposals and make agreements with UO departments in a timely manner.\n\nCHC affiliated faculty are generally compensated at the standard UO course buyout rate, and through various mechanisms consisting of buyouts, direct hires, overloads, and in some cases trades/exchanges.

The Sustainability Faculty Fellowship will provide opportunities to connect with prominent community partners and provide fellows with a network of colleagues (across discipline and rank) who seek to incorporate issues of sustainability into their curricula.\nFaculty fellows will receive a $500 award and will take part in a three-day workshop discussing issues of sustainability and methods for designing community-engaged learning experiences.

2016-12-22 11:07:20,b'coe-fac: Four free COE workshops on R in Winter term!',b'Leslie D Leve',b'leve@uoregon.edu',b'http://lists-prod.uoregon.edu/pipermail/coe-fac/2016/000293.html',"b'<pre>Greetings COE faculty!\n\nFollowing on the announcement at the COE faculty-staff meeting a few weeks ago, I wanted to announce the free methodology workshops offered this Winter term for COE faculty. We are very fortunate to have experts in the R software program in our college. One of those experts (Daniel Anderson) will lead the workshops, which will provide an excellent foundation for faculty interested in learning R and/or faculty wanting to support graduate students in the future as they learn the program. See below or attached flier for details.\n\nThanks, and have a good holiday everyone,\nLeslie\n\n\n\nA Taste of R\nFree Workshop for Faculty\n\nR is a free, open-source, and tremendously powerful and flexible software for data analysis. Thousands of users across the globe contribute to R on a nearly daily basis, providing users with access to cutting edge analyses and, often, some of the most modern thinking in statistical methodology. Many educational and statistical doctoral programs have begun adopting R as the primary software for statistics courses.\n\nDr. Daniel Anderson of the Center on Teaching and Learning (CTL) and the Behavioral Research and Teaching Center (BRT) will offer 4 free workshops on R.\n\nPurpose: To provide faculty with a basic introduction to R (no advanced statistical prerequisite skills required) that will orient faculty as to why R is a unique, powerful, and flexible tool for manipulating, summarizing, and visualizing data.\n\nWhen: 12:00- 2:00 pm, on the following dates: January 20, February 3, February 17, March 3. Workshop topics are listed below. Daniel will also be available for individual or research group meetings outside of the workshops. In the spring term, Daniel will offer a formal course open to faculty, doctoral, and masters students.\n\nWhere: A COE classroom TBA. Sessions will also be recorded for later viewing.\n\nHow do I sign up?: Email us at <a href=""https://lists-prod.uoregon.edu/mailman/listinfo/coe-fac"">daniela at uoregon.edu</a>&lt;mailto:<a href=""https://lists-prod.uoregon.edu/mailman/listinfo/coe-fac"">daniela at uoregon.edu</a>&gt; and <a href=""https://lists-prod.uoregon.edu/mailman/listinfo/coe-fac"">leve at uoregon.edu</a>&lt;mailto:<a href=""https://lists-prod.uoregon.edu/mailman/listinfo/coe-fac"">leve at uoregon.edu</a>&gt;\n\nWorkshop #1: What is R and why should I care?\n\n\xc2\xb7      This session introduces R and external packages, addressing the basics of a reproducible workflow and data visualizations.  A broad overview is provided for the R landscape, illustrating both its power and flexibility.\n\nWorkshop #2: Tidy data\n\n\xc2\xb7      The concept of tidy data, introduced by Hadley Wickham, is a technical term to describe a specific data structure. As Hadley notes, ""Tidy datasets are all alike, but every messy dataset is messy in its own way"". This session introduces the concept of tidy data, explains why it is useful, and covers tools to help get your data into a tidy format through R.\n\nWorkshop #3: Data visualization\n\n\xc2\xb7      Numerous data visualization packages are discussed with an emphasis on fast and powerful exploratory plotting.\n\nWorkshop #4: Bring your own data\n\n\xc2\xb7      The final session focuses on individual participant datasets to tackle real challenges. One or two datasets will be explored in depth, including data manipulation, visualization, and basic analysis.\n\n\n\n***********\nLeslie Leve, PhD\nProfessor and Associate Dean for Research and Faculty Development\nCollege of Education\nAssociate Director, Prevention Science Institute\nUniversity of Oregon\n\nPhone: 541-346-9601\nWeb: <a href=""https://education.uoregon.edu/users/leslie-leve"">https://education.uoregon.edu/users/leslie-leve</a>\n\n[Macintosh HD:Users:tjordan:Documents:current-jobs:__UO branding main:__UO Brand Elements Jun15:UO Business Papers:Electronic letterhead:UO Secondary Sig LH:UO Digital LH - COE:COE-3435-CGY11-4C.png]\n\n-------------- next part --------------\nAn HTML attachment was scrubbed...\nURL: &lt;<a href=""http://lists-prod.uoregon.edu/pipermail/coe-fac/attachments/20161222/e9edfa98/attachment-0001.html"">http://lists-prod.uoregon.edu/pipermail/coe-fac/attachments/20161222/e9edfa98/attachment-0001.html</a>&gt;\n-------------- next part --------------\nA non-text attachment was scrubbed...\nName: AE3FFCA6-2360-46C9-B5E5-A45464715BB0.png\nType: image/png\nSize: 10915 bytes\nDesc: AE3FFCA6-2360-46C9-B5E5-A45464715BB0.png\nURL: &lt;<a href=""http://lists-prod.uoregon.edu/pipermail/coe-fac/attachments/20161222/e9edfa98/attachment-0001.png"">http://lists-prod.uoregon.edu/pipermail/coe-fac/attachments/20161222/e9edfa98/attachment-0001.png</a>&gt;\n-------------- next part --------------\nA non-text attachment was scrubbed...\nName: TasteOfRv4_flier.docx\nType: application/vnd.openxmlformats-officedocument.wordprocessingml.document\nSize: 142002 bytes\nDesc: TasteOfRv4_flier.docx\nURL: &lt;<a href=""http://lists-prod.uoregon.edu/pipermail/coe-fac/attachments/20161222/e9edfa98/attachment-0001.docx"">http://lists-prod.uoregon.edu/pipermail/coe-fac/attachments/20161222/e9edfa98/attachment-0001.docx</a>&gt;\n</pre>'","b'Greetings COE faculty!\n\nFollowing on the announcement at the COE faculty-staff meeting a few weeks ago, I wanted to announce the free methodology workshops offered this Winter term for COE faculty.

We are very fortunate to have experts in the R software program in our college. One of those experts (Daniel Anderson) will lead the workshops, which will provide an excellent foundation for faculty interested in learning R and/or faculty wanting to support graduate students in the future as they learn the program. See below or attached flier for details.\n\nThanks, and have a good holiday everyone,\nLeslie\n\n\nA Taste of R\nFree Workshop for Faculty\n\nR is a free, open-source, and tremendously powerful and flexible software for data analysis. Thousands of users across the globe contribute to R on a nearly daily basis, providing users with access to cutting edge analyses and, often, some of the most modern thinking in statistical methodology. Many educational and statistical doctoral programs have begun adopting R as the primary software for statistics courses.\n\nDr. Daniel Anderson of the Center on Teaching and Learning (CTL) and the Behavioral Research and Teaching Center (BRT) will offer 4 free workshops on R.\n\nPurpose: To provide faculty with a basic introduction to R (no advanced statistical prerequisite skills required) that will orient faculty as to why R is a unique, powerful, and flexible tool for manipulating, summarizing, and visualizing data.\n\nWhen: 12:00- 2:00 pm, on the following dates: January 20, February 3, February 17, March 3. Workshop topics are listed below. Daniel will also be available for individual or research group meetings outside of the workshops. In the spring term, Daniel will offer a formal course open to faculty, doctoral, and masters students.\n\nWhere: 340 Hedco (Jan 20) and 230T Hedco (Feb 3, Feb 17, March 3). Sessions will be recorded for live or later viewing.\n\nHow do I sign up?: Email us at <a href=""https://lists-prod.uoregon.edu/mailman/listinfo/coe-fac"">daniela at uoregon.edu</a>&lt;mailto:<a href=""https://lists-prod.uoregon.edu/mailman/listinfo/coe-fac"">daniela at uoregon.edu</a>&gt; and <a href=""https://lists-prod.uoregon.edu/mailman/listinfo/coe-fac"">leve at uoregon.edu</a>&lt;mailto:<a href=""https://lists-prod.uoregon.edu/mailman/listinfo/coe-fac"">leve at uoregon.edu</a>&gt;\n\nWorkshop #1: What is R and why should I care?\n\n\xc2\xb7      This session introduces R and external packages, addressing the basics of a reproducible workflow and data visualizations.  A broad overview is provided for the R landscape, illustrating both its power and flexibility.\n\nWorkshop #2: Tidy data\n\n\xc2\xb7      The concept of tidy data, introduced by Hadley Wickham, is a technical term to describe a specific data structure. As Hadley notes, ""Tidy datasets are all alike, but every messy dataset is messy in its own way"". This session introduces the concept of tidy data, explains why it is useful, and covers tools to help get your data into a tidy format through R.\n\nWorkshop #3: Data visualization\n\n\xc2\xb7      Numerous data visualization packages are discussed with an emphasis on fast and powerful exploratory plotting.\n\nWorkshop #4: Bring your own data\n\n\xc2\xb7      The final session focuses on individual participant datasets to tackle real challenges. One or two datasets will be explored in depth, including data manipulation, visualization, and basic analysis.\n\n\n***********\nLeslie Leve, PhD\nProfessor and Associate Dean for Research and Faculty Development\nCollege of Education\nAssociate Director, Prevention Science Institute\nUniversity of Oregon\n\nPhone: 541-346-9601\nWeb: <a href=""https://education.uoregon.edu/users/leslie-leve"">https://education.uoregon.edu/users/leslie-leve</a>\n\n[Macintosh HD:Users:tjordan:Documents:current-jobs:__UO branding main:__UO Brand Elements Jun15:UO Business Papers:Electronic letterhead:UO Secondary Sig LH:UO Digital LH - COE:COE-3435-CGY11-4C.png]\n\n-------------- next part --------------\nAn HTML attachment was scrubbed...\nURL: &lt;<a href=""http://lists-prod.uoregon.edu/pipermail/coe-fac/attachments/20170112/18906d8e/attachment-0001.html"">http://lists-prod.uoregon.edu/pipermail/coe-fac/attachments/20170112/18906d8e/attachment-0001.html</a>&gt;\n-------------- next part --------------\nA non-text attachment was scrubbed...\nName: AE3FFCA6-2360-46C9-B5E5-A45464715BB0.png\nType: image/png\nSize: 10915 bytes\nDesc: AE3FFCA6-2360-46C9-B5E5-A45464715BB0.png\nURL: &lt;<a href=""http://lists-prod.uoregon.edu/pipermail/coe-fac/attachments/20170112/18906d8e/attachment-0001.png"">http://lists-prod.uoregon.edu/pipermail/coe-fac/attachments/20170112/18906d8e/attachment-0001.png</a>&gt;\n-------------- next part --------------\nA non-text attachment was scrubbed...\nName: TasteOfRv4_flier.docx\nType: application/vnd.openxmlformats-officedocument.wordprocessingml.document\nSize: 144449 bytes\nDesc: TasteOfRv4_flier.docx\nURL: &lt;<a href=""http://lists-prod.uoregon.edu/pipermail/coe-fac/attachments/20170112/18906d8e/attachment-0001.docx"">http://lists-prod.uoregon.edu/pipermail/coe-fac/attachments/20170112/18906d8e/attachment-0001.docx</a>&gt;\n</pre>'","b'Hello faculty,\n\nA reminder to faculty to sign up for the free R workshops if you plan to attend.

Thousands of users across the globe contribute to R on a nearly daily basis, providing users with access to cutting edge analyses and, often, some of the most modern thinking in statistical methodology. Many educational and statistical doctoral programs have begun adopting R as the primary software for statistics courses.\n\nDr. Daniel Anderson of the Center on Teaching and Learning (CTL) and the Behavioral Research and Teaching Center (BRT) will offer 4 free workshops on R.\n\nPurpose: To provide faculty with a basic introduction to R (no advanced statistical prerequisite skills required) that will orient faculty as to why R is a unique, powerful, and flexible tool for manipulating, summarizing, and visualizing data.\n\nWhen: 12:00- 2:00 pm, on the following dates: January 20, February 3, February 17, March 3. Workshop topics are listed below. Daniel will also be available for individual or research group meetings outside of the workshops. In the spring term, Daniel will offer a formal course open to faculty, doctoral, and masters students.\n\nWhere: 340 Hedco (Jan 20) and 230T Hedco (Feb 3, Feb 17, March 3).

Rental regalia includes standard black gown and the appropriate hood for your Alma Mater. To guarantee exact hood colors please use the link below to make your order by May 5.  After that time it may be necessary to substitute a hood with the closest available colors or Oregon colors.\nOn the order form, choose the Spring 2017 ceremony.

On graduation day (Monday, June 19), we ask that you show up in your regalia at Matt Knight Arena at 3:15 pm (about 45 minutes before the ceremony begins).  There will be COE staff on hand to show you where to line up and walk in.  There will be a few presentations, we will hood our doctoral students and then the remaining students will cross the stage and shake the dean\'s hand while their names are read.  The ceremony lasts about 2 hours.\nI\'ll be sending out more specific information with exact times and locations, but feel free to ask me any questions.  I also love talking with students about Commencement, so let me know if I can do any class visits or provide them any information.\nThanks,\nLisa\n\n\n\n\nLisa Fortin\nDirector of Events and Student Recruitment\nCollege of Education, University of Oregon\nPh:  541-346-1607\n\n-------------- next part --------------\nAn HTML attachment was scrubbed...\nURL: &lt;<a href=""http://lists-prod.uoregon.edu/pipermail/coe-fac/attachments/20170331/ff0e4576/attachment.html"">http://lists-prod.uoregon.edu/pipermail/coe-fac/attachments/20170331/ff0e4576/attachment.html</a>&gt;\n</pre>'","b""Hello,\nWith the number of new faculty in the COE I thought I would send out a little information on how faculty participate in our Commencement Ceremony.\nWe encourage any and all faculty to participate.

The process for eligible faculty will be the same process that was undertaken last year. The timeframe, materials, and process for eligible faculty are described below.\n[Note: The process steps described below apply to eligible faculty only. Pro tem, adjunct, and visiting faculty members, retired faculty members in appointments outside of the TRP program, and postdoctoral scholars are ineligible.  For OAs, merit review process is based on the OA merit policy. Eligible UO OAs received an email dated 9.27.17 from the VPFA describing the OA process and timeline.]\n\nFaculty Merit process:\nDepartment and Unit Heads will submit merit recommendations to the Dean\'s office. The Dean\'s office will make final decisions regarding merit. Merit increases will take effect January 1st 2018. Please review the information below and send the requested materials to your Department or Unit Heads by October 31, 2017.\n\n\n\nTimeframe:\n\n*         The period of the current 2017 merit review extends back to the last performance assessment end date (which was October 31st, 2016), and runs through October 31st 2017.

By writing, academics can reach audiences in publications locally, nationally, and internationally. Stories are regularly republished in large national outlets such as The Washington Post, Time, Newsweek, CNN, Scientific American and many more. Through partnerships with The Associated Press and Community Newspaper Holdings, Inc. articles are picked up in local newspapers \xe2\x80\x93 providing analysis in communities that may not otherwise hear from these academics.

This of course first refers to peer-reviewed research, but then secondly as published editorial content to a broader audience both nationally and globally.

While there will be a broader session for all faculty on campus, I have negotiated for us to have our own COE focused workshop for our faculty members interested in learning how to write for the site\xe2\x80\x99s non-academic audiences.\n\nWhat: Free COE Workshop with The Conversation\nWhen: Thursday, February 15 3:30 pm - 4:30 pm\nWhere: HEDCO 230-T\n\nAs a recap from Kyle Henley and Molly Blancett\xe2\x80\x99s presentation at our last Faculty and Staff meeting, The Conversation is an independent, nonprofit publisher of commentary and analysis, authored by academics and edited by journalists for the general public. The site publishes short articles (800-1,000 words) by academics on timely topics related to their research. By writing, academics can reach audiences in publications locally, nationally, and internationally. Stories are regularly republished in large national outlets such as The Washington Post, Time, Newsweek, CNN, Scientific American and many more. Through partnerships with The Associated Press and Community Newspaper Holdings, Inc. articles are picked up in local newspapers \xe2\x80\x93 providing analysis in communities that may not otherwise hear from these academics. Many of our peer faculty at other universities across the country and around the world are also paying attention to what The Conversation is publishing, or stories that are republished from this site.\n\nDuring the workshop, Wilson will guide attendees through how to craft a pitch and advise them on what it takes to write for The Conversation.\n\nWilson is a former publisher of The Chronicles of Higher Education and Philanthropy. He also served as the director of higher education at NBC Learn.\n\nTo learn more about The Conversation, click on this link<http://theconversation.com/us/introduction?utm_medium=email&utm_campaign=Expert%20Request%20the%20lure%20of%20unhealthy%20food%20Taye%20lawsuit%20and%20more&utm_content=Expert%20Request%20the%20lure%20of%20unhealthy%20food%20Taye%20lawsuit%20and%20more+CID_e29ed45ef36e76082e9c68567d669480&utm_source=campaign_monitor_us&utm_term=send%20them%20this%20link>.\n\n\n\nTo attend, email Molly Blancett at blancett at uoregon.edu<mailto:blancett at uoregon.edu>.\n\nWhile we encourage you to attend this workshop specific to the COE, if you are unable to make this time, you are encouraged to join the university-wide workshop scheduled the following day:\nWhat: All UO Workshop with The Conversation\nWhen: Friday from 10:30 am -11:30 am\nWhere: EMU Lease Crutcher Room 23.\n\nI hope you all can attend.\n\nBest,\nJessica\n\nJessica Roberts\nDirector of Communications\nCollege of Education\n541.346.8979\n\n-------------- next part --------------\nAn HTML attachment was scrubbed...\nURL: <http://lists-prod.uoregon.edu/pipermail/coe-fac/attachments/20180213/dc4cd7f6/attachment.html>\n'"

Rental regalia includes standard black gown and the appropriate hood for your Alma Mater. To guarantee exact hood colors please use the link below to make your order by May 11.  After that time it may be necessary to substitute a hood with the closest available colors or Oregon colors.\nOn the order form, choose the Spring 2018 ceremony.  As the COE covers the cost of renting regalia for the ceremony, choose \'bill index\' in the payment area and just put in CCFGEN or COE.\n\nOrder your regalia here:\n<a href=""http://www.uoduckstore.com/regalia-rental-form"">http://www.uoduckstore.com/regalia-rental-form</a>\n\nIf you had any problems with your regalia last year, please let me know so we can make the necessary corrections.

On graduation day (Monday, June 18), we ask that you show up in your regalia at Matt Knight Arena at 3:15 pm (about 45 minutes before the ceremony begins).  There will be COE staff on hand to show you where to line up and walk in.  There will be a few presentations, we will hood our doctoral students and then the remaining students will cross the stage and shake the dean\'s hand while their names are read.  The ceremony lasts about 2 hours.\nI\'ll be sending out more specific information with exact times and locations, but feel free to ask me any questions.  I also love talking with students about Commencement, so let me know if I can do any class visits or provide them any information.\nThanks,\nLisa\n\n\n\n\nLisa Fortin\nDirector of Events and Student Recruitment\nCollege of Education, University of Oregon\nPh:  541-346-1607\n\n-------------- next part --------------\nAn HTML attachment was scrubbed...\nURL: &lt;<a href=""http://lists-prod.uoregon.edu/pipermail/coe-fac/attachments/20180507/80553ab9/attachment.html"">http://lists-prod.uoregon.edu/pipermail/coe-fac/attachments/20180507/80553ab9/attachment.html</a>&gt;\n</pre>'","b""Hello,\nFor those of you who don't own your own regalia, the COE will cover the cost for your rental for our graduation ceremony.

SAIL offers free summer programs to students from local high schools where they spend a week during the summer, where they travel to campus every day to learn some of the important steps they need to know about college life and gaining access to college. Programming typically includes offerings that provide information on the administrative side of things such as registration and financial aid, as well as introductory presentations around the various different majors and disciplines on campus.\n\nThis year, once again we have staff from all of our undergraduate majors and minors who have volunteered to be part of SAIL and to provide a session or two in which they will share information about a specific program in the College of Education. Our presentations are typically very engaging and they tend to peak high schoolers\' interest in how they might impact or become advocates for social change.\n\nI\'m writing today because we still need one or two more volunteers to provide about 3 hours of COE-specific programming for this year\'s SAIL cohort of high-schoolers. We have a slot open on Tuesday, July 17 from 1:15 pm - 3 pm and another spot from 2 pm - 3 pm on Wednesday, July 18.  Ideally, we would fill those two slots with two different presentations (or activities).\n\nFor those who may never have presented for a SAIL cohort before, we typically provide programming that is part lecture and information (providing insight into a college experience), and part engagement (something that gives the students an opportunity to fully engage with the speaker and each other around the topic at hand). This year we will have 20-25 rising juniors and seniors in our class.\n\nI had a presenter who ended up being unable to present at the last minute, so please forgive the short notice request this year.

Tutors will gain valuable experience planning and delivering research-based reading or math instruction to K-2nd grade students, monitoring their academic progress, and writing weekly progress reports and a summary report to parents. The clinic is a great site to complete field experience hours. Tutors can expect to spend 4 hours per week to earn 1 credit at the clinic. Of those four hours, tutors will work face-to-face with an assigned individual or group of students for two 50-minute sessions a week.  Remaining time will be dedicated to lesson preparation, data summary for parents, and ongoing feedback/training sessions with an assigned supervisor. U of O students who wish to work more hours at the clinic (e.g. 6-7 hours a week for 2 credits) can be assigned to tutor for two hours 2 days per week or one hour 4 days per week. Tutors may apply for a single term or tutor for multiple terms.\n\nOur Reading and Math Intervention Assessment and Intervention Clinic offers group and individual tutoring services for school-age children (currently, kindergarten - 2nd grade) who are struggling in the areas of reading or math due to learning and attention difficulties and disabilities, including dyslexia and dyscalculia. Our trained, supervised undergraduate and graduate student tutors deliver instructional interventions that are backed by rigorous research evidence and teach critical concepts and skills in reading and math, as defined by decades of research, including the National Reading Panel (2000), the National Research Council (2001), and the National Math Advisory Panel (2008).\n\nTutor Application and flyer can be accessed directly from our website:\n <a href=""https://ctlreadingclinic.uoregon.edu/tutors.html?"">https://ctlreadingclinic.uoregon.edu/tutors.html?</a>\n\nFind flyer enclosed in this email if easier to print and share.\nLink here: <a href=""https://ctlreadingclinic.uoregon.edu/forms/tutor-flyer-fall2018.pdf?"">https://ctlreadingclinic.uoregon.edu/forms/tutor-flyer-fall2018.pdf?</a>\n\nDo not hesitate to reach me, or Anna Ingram at <a href=""https://lists-prod.uoregon.edu/mailman/listinfo/coe-fac"">annad at uoregon.edu</a>, with any questions.\n\nBest,?\n\n\n\nRuby Batz, PhD.\nResearch Associate\nCenter on Teaching and Learning\nCollege of Education, University of Oregon\n     1600 Millrace Drive, Suite 245\n\n[cid:e9ba47fa-5e02-412c-9eb3-2ce3b08db677]\n-------------- next part --------------\nAn HTML attachment was scrubbed...\nURL: &lt;<a href=""http://lists-prod.uoregon.edu/pipermail/coe-fac/attachments/20180919/bf6ff727/attachment-0001.html"">http://lists-prod.uoregon.edu/pipermail/coe-fac/attachments/20180919/bf6ff727/attachment-0001.html</a>&gt;\n-------------- next part --------------\nA non-text attachment was scrubbed...\nName: pastedImage.png\nType: image/png\nSize: 583251 bytes\nDesc: pastedImage.png\nURL: &lt;<a href=""http://lists-prod.uoregon.edu/pipermail/coe-fac/attachments/20180919/bf6ff727/attachment-0001.png"">http://lists-prod.uoregon.edu/pipermail/coe-fac/attachments/20180919/bf6ff727/attachment-0001.png</a>&gt;\n</pre>'","b'\nDear faculty,\n\nwishing your fall term is starting up successfully!\n\nIf relevant, and appropriate for your students enrolled in your courses/programs, please consider sharing this tutoring opportunity for fall term (and the whole academic year) at the Center on Teaching and Learning (CTL) housed in the HEDCO Clinic.\n\nUndergraduate students and graduate students from the College of Education at the University of Oregon are encouraged to apply to tutor at the CTL Clinic.

These new requirements are the result of several years of discussions with faculty, the University Senate and Senate committees, and represent an exciting upgrade for our students.  As the intention of these new requirements was to drive change in the curriculum, we do expect that many faculty will have to give some careful thought as to how their courses will meet the new criteria. Submission entails a completed Courseleaf form by end of Spring term which will include a description of how the course meets the new criteria.  These will be submitted directly to the UOCC and not go through the college curriculum committee. Full instructions will be sent in a separate email.\n\nI\xe2\x80\x99ve heard back from many but not all of you. So that I can plan for summer resources, I need to know which courses you will be putting through this year, and which, if any, courses will not be submitted at all for review against the new criteria. You are strongly encouraged to put through some, if not all, of your courses this year so that we can even the workload over the next 3 years.\n\nI\xe2\x80\x99d appreciate a response with those details by January 18, 5:00pm.\n\nWe are offering two workshops in January to help faculty learn about the new requirements and how to best tailor their courses to meet those requirements (see <a href=""https://tep.uoregon.edu/workshops-and-events"">https://tep.uoregon.edu/workshops-and-events</a>).

As Kent and I consider the possible points of intersection for this work with our college, it was helpful for us to learn that the CEP defines equity in terms of the following 5 lenses for the purpose of managing the potentially broad scope the work:\n\n\n  *   Discipline (especially exclusionary practices in discipline and mental health)\n  *   Language (especially dual language)\n  *   Inclusion (of students with disabilities)\n  *   Tribal needs and causes\n  *   Maternal and child health track (CEP has a significant focus on birth to early elementary school aged children.)\n\n\nAlso, we confirmed that the objective of the partnership is to harness the skillset and capacity of experts in national institutions and across like projects towards impacting two predominant areas:\n\n  *   Data and research and\n  *   Policy\n\n\nWhile they have multiple projects underway, the CEP recently invited the UO to participate in two upcoming projects.\n\n  *   A response to the White House\'s recent School Safety Report\n  *   The development of a report on the State of Equity in the nation (in the 5 areas)\n\nWe plan to reach out to those who have already expressed interest in the coming days (thank you!). However, we will continue to provide occasional and more targeted updates as the work takes shape and takes on a predictable format. We may also take the liberty of reaching out with tentative invitations to specific faculty if we think there may be points of synergy that make sense with your work as we understand it.

CEP is working on designing and carrying out a cohesive and comprehensive national equity agenda across early childhood research, policy, and practice and has invited universities with evidence of strong research and practical successes in the area of early childhood research, policy, and practice to serve as part of their decision-making and action oriented coalition.\n\nWhile the partnership is based in our college\'s equity work and goals, we already see potential synergies with our existing research and academic faculty and would like to make you aware of the potential for developments and opportunities for our extended faculty working in these areas.\n\nSee the document attached for additional information.

As Kent and I consider the possible points of intersection for this work with our college, it was helpful for us to learn that the CEP defines equity in terms of the following 5 lenses for the purpose of managing the potentially broad scope the work:\n\n\n  *   Discipline (especially exclusionary practices in discipline and mental health)\n  *   Language (especially dual language)\n  *   Inclusion (of students with disabilities)\n  *   Tribal needs and causes\n  *   Maternal and child health track (CEP has a significant focus on birth to early elementary school aged children.)\n\n\nAlso, we confirmed that the objective of the partnership is to harness the skillset and capacity of experts in national institutions and across like projects towards impacting two predominant areas:\n\n  *   Data and research and\n  *   Policy\n\n\nWhile they have multiple projects underway, the CEP recently invited the UO to participate in two upcoming projects.\n\n  *   A response to the White House's recent School Safety Report\n  *   The development of a report on the State of Equity in the nation (in the 5 areas)\n\nWe plan to reach out to those who have already expressed interest in the coming days (thank you!). However, we will continue to provide occasional and more targeted updates as the work takes shape and takes on a predictable format. We may also take the liberty of reaching out with tentative invitations to specific faculty if we think there may be points of synergy that make sense with your work as we understand it. Again, please feel free to reach out to Kent or I with questions.\n\nBest,\nDianna\n\n\nFrom: coe-fac-bounces at lists.uoregon.edu<mailto:coe-fac-bounces at lists.uoregon.edu> [mailto:coe-fac-bounces at lists.uoregon.edu] On Behalf Of Dianna Carrizales-Engelmann\nSent: Wednesday, December 05, 2018 8:46 AM\nTo: coe-fac at lists.uoregon.edu<mailto:coe-fac at lists.uoregon.edu>\nSubject: coe-fac: Children's Equity Project Partnership\n\nDear Faculty,\n\nAs part of our ongoing activities related to the academic and practical pursuits of equity in our college, I am pleased to share that we recently agreed to partner with the Children's Equity Project (CEP), a multi-university initiative out of the Arizona State University led by Dr. Shantel Meek. CEP is working on designing and carrying out a cohesive and comprehensive national equity agenda across early childhood research, policy, and practice and has invited universities with evidence of strong research and practical successes in the area of early childhood research, policy, and practice to serve as part of their decision-making and action oriented coalition.\n\nWhile the partnership is based in our college's equity work and goals, we already see potential synergies with our existing research and academic faculty and would like to make you aware of the potential for developments and opportunities for our extended faculty working in these areas.\n\nSee the document attached for additional information. Kent McIntosh and myself will be serving as primary contacts and liaisons for this work and we are excited to expand this partnership within the college. We will provide you with updates as we understand more about the scope of the CEP project, however, please feel free to contact either of us for more information or questions.\n\nBest,\nDianna\n\n\nDianna Carrizales-Engelmann, Ph.D.,\n\nDirector of Administration\nCollege of Education\n1215 University of Oregon\n(541) 346-5407\n\n-------------- next part --------------\nAn HTML attachment was scrubbed...\nURL: <http://lists-prod.uoregon.edu/pipermail/coe-fac/attachments/20190124/36e505dd/attachment-0001.html>\n"""

I know this is only one of many welcome back messages you will be receiving in the next few days, so I thought it might be good to share one that is primarily informative.\nAs of December 5th, 2017, both of the COE\'s faculty workload policies were finalized following their respective CBA policy development phases <a href=""https://coedocs.uoregon.edu/pages/viewpage.action?pageId=8912911"">https://coedocs.uoregon.edu/pages/viewpage.action?pageId=8912911</a> . This means that we are starting the 2018 - 2019 academic year with both of our CBA workload policies intact. While it is important to acknowledge that these policies have been (and will likely continue to be) debated in the appropriate forums throughout the college, these policies are now in place. The full implementation of these policies and any related changes to our practices, will begin this 2018-2019 academic year along with the collection of data that will inform any future changes that are deemed necessary (based on the policies\' implementation). As noted in previous communications, both the NTTF and TTF policies have anticipated the formation of review committees (Task Forces) who will review their implementation to address any concerns that may arise.\nAs we continue to implement these new policies, Department Heads will be engaged in the careful facilitation of certain processes:\n\n*       Development of individual Work Assignment documents: Department Heads will complete these with their faculty annually to document workload per faculty member (instructional and non-instructional) and note any caveats, changes, or specific arrangements.\n\n*       Collection of annual workload data by department: Department Heads will complete these with their Business Managers to document workload per department and note any caveats, changes, or specific arrangements.\n\n*       Review of any NTTF position descriptions in order to identify and develop consistent language for non-instructional (administrative) duties across programs and departments.\n\n*       Development of task-specific job descriptions for administrative (i.e. non-instructional) roles, such as Program Coordinator and Program Director.\n\n\nThese activities will generate the most change in those NTTF position descriptions that list administrative (non-instructional) responsibilities. Many of these discussions began in departments last year. Any changes that come about as a result of the bullets above will be made in consultation with Department Heads and Program Leadership and with input from impacted (potentially impacted) faculty as appropriate.\nBecause the work that faculty engages in is multi-dimensional, we know that some of the content of the policies will not fit all of the unique circumstances that we might encounter, for that reason, the Implementation Guidance document (attached) was created and distributed to provide Department Heads with support as they navigate unique and nuanced circumstances of our faculty\'s day to day reality.\nFeel free to follow up with me if you have any questions.\n\nBest,\n\nDianna\n\nDianna Carrizales-Engelmann, Ph.D.,\nDirector of Administration,\nCollege of Education\n(541) 346-5407\n\n\n-------------- next part --------------\nAn HTML attachment was scrubbed...\nURL: &lt;<a href=""http://lists-prod.uoregon.edu/pipermail/coe-fac/attachments/20190222/435d4bd1/attachment-0001.html"">http://lists-prod.uoregon.edu/pipermail/coe-fac/attachments/20190222/435d4bd1/attachment-0001.html</a>&gt;\n-------------- next part --------------\nA non-text attachment was scrubbed...\nName: CoETeachingLoadImplementationGuidanceJanuary2017RWK MM 2 14 18_Returned (15).pdf\nType: application/pdf\nSize: 120586 bytes\nDesc: CoETeachingLoadImplementationGuidanceJanuary2017RWK MM 2 14 18_Returned (15).pdf\nURL: &lt;<a href=""http://lists-prod.uoregon.edu/pipermail/coe-fac/attachments/20190222/435d4bd1/attachment-0001.pdf"">http://lists-prod.uoregon.edu/pipermail/coe-fac/attachments/20190222/435d4bd1/attachment-0001.pdf</a>&gt;\n-------------- next part --------------\nAn embedded and charset-unspecified text was scrubbed...\nName: ATT00001.txt\nURL: &lt;<a href=""http://lists-prod.uoregon.edu/pipermail/coe-fac/attachments/20190222/435d4bd1/attachment-0001.txt"">http://lists-prod.uoregon.edu/pipermail/coe-fac/attachments/20190222/435d4bd1/attachment-0001.txt</a>&gt;\n</pre>'","b'Dear Faculty,\nAs ""workload planning session"" activities will be beginning in departments in the coming weeks (see NTTF Work Planning Sessions Winter/Spring 2019 email dated February 1st), I am resending this September email that provides some additional context.\nBest,\nDianna\nFrom: coe-staff-bounces at lists.uoregon.edu<mailto:coe-staff-bounces at lists.uoregon.edu> [mailto:coe-staff-bounces at lists.uoregon.edu] On Behalf Of Dianna Carrizales-Engelmann\nSent: Friday, September 14, 2018 10:09 AM\nTo: coe-staff at lists.uoregon.edu<mailto:coe-staff at lists.uoregon.edu>\nSubject: coe-staff: 2018-2019 Workload policy update\n\nDear Faculty,\nWelcome back!

This transfer means she is no longer eligible to serve in her position as a COE-elected faculty senator. This creates a vacancy in the University Senate for a statutory faculty member. The vacancy is for the remainder of this academic year and for academic year 2019-2020. We will conduct a mini-election the first week of term to fill this vacancy. Please email Angela Wilhelms (<a href=""https://lists-prod.uoregon.edu/mailman/listinfo/coe-fac"">wilhelms at uoregon.edu</a>&lt;mailto:<a href=""https://lists-prod.uoregon.edu/mailman/listinfo/coe-fac"">wilhelms at uoregon.edu</a>&gt;) with a cc to Dianna Carrizales-Engelmann by Wednesday, March 27 if you are interested in running to fill this vacancy, or have a colleague to nominate.  There is no restriction on which department a senator may come from, but because two remaining senators are both from SPECS, we do support the idea of diversifying your representation. Again, this is not a preclusion on anyone who wants to run...maybe just a little prod to other departments...\n\nIt is worth noting that regular annual university senate and committee elections are coming up in late April. Two COE positions will be up for election this year for full two-year terms. Sitting senators may seek re-election, but others are of course welcome to run.

Our current unlimited access model has proven to be very expensive, so we will be prioritizing licensing films that are being used for teaching and research purposes. This means that starting this summer, you will need to request access to new films that you\'d like to use. We have already purchased multi-year licenses for films in the Janus/Criterion collection and several other widely-used titles. All titles currently under license will continue to be available. I should have more information on this to share with you in the future once our Collections Services staff has finalized the procedures for faculty to request films needed for instruction.\n\nPlease let me know if you have any questions about this or any of the other steps outlined in the memo.

We have already purchased multi-year licenses for films in the Janus/Criterion collection and several other widely-used titles. All titles currently under license will continue to be available. I should have more information on this to share with you in the future once our Collections Services staff has finalized the procedures for faculty to request films needed for instruction.\n\nPlease let me know if you have any questions about this or any of the other steps outlined in the memo. You can also contact Dean Lim or Associate Dean Mark Watson with questions as well.\n\nBest,\nKatherine\n\n--\nKatherine S.

In anticipation of a busy school year, I wanted to send this message as soon as possible in the hope that we can make some policy-headway early in the quarter.\n\nWe have achieved several significant policy undertakings in the past 4 years. Since 2015, the COE has undertaken the development of 8 CBA-driven policies and we are now in the full implementation of those policies and their related guidelines.  In some cases data have been collected, in some cases change is already visible, and in all cases, lessons have been learned.\n\n\nAs some of you may be aware, according to our COE Internal governance, all 8 of these policies are now technically due or will be due for review in the 2020 calendar year.  According to COE Internal Governance Policy: COE Policies shall be reviewed and voted upon by representative faculty at least every 3 years (lines 601-602). This creates a situation in which multiple faculty committees will be created and convened over the course of the year, likely with some overlap.\n\nWhile our faculty governance does not address all situations that arise in the college, it does give us a process (i.e., the faculty governance process) with which to approach scenarios like this one.  The survey below proposes 6 possible ways forward to potentially mitigate some of the strain associated with the faculty's full review of 8 policies in a single year https://coedocs.uoregon.edu/display/governance/COE+Policy+Library. The options fall into 3 general categories:\n(1) proceed with the full review for all 8 policies,\n(2) prioritize a group of policies for review in the short term and planfully develop a sequence for the others, or\n(3) change to the internal governance (to either suggest an alternate review period or to develop/vote on an expedited process that can be used with certain policies).\n\n\nPlease let me know by October10th, via the following Qualtrics survey https://oregon.qualtrics.com/jfe/form/SV_e4Xl5H8ya4IGKnr<https://urldefense.com/v3/__https:/oregon.qualtrics.com/jfe/form/SV_e4Xl5H8ya4IGKnr__;!5W9E9PnL_ac!Vlir7VdcpLzbQCZT4-tno2pY9uuNUzM2QDNIq5ckzbGmJ8-xl-VH48B40fYwkp8QwQ$> your thoughts about the ideal way to proceed with this work so that we have a streamlined 2019-2020 academic year and are not overly embedded in policy review.\n\n\nThe results of this survey will be consolidated by October 18th so that next steps for COE policy review can proceed in the Fall and Winter quarters.\n\nBest,\n\n\nDianna\n\n---------------\nDianna Carrizales-Engelmann, PhD\nAssistant Dean for Administration, College of Education\ndcarriza at uoregon.edu<mailto:dcarriza at uoregon.edu> | 541-346-5407\n1215 University of Oregon | Eugene, OR 97403-5277\n\nI support all students regardless of immigration status or country of origin.
