*This is a less-clickbaity, less listy expansion to a [previous post](/blog/2021-03-01-Systems-Neuro-Infrastructure) that is and should read as a manifesto rather than an empirical work. Some parts of the previous piece are repeated here. The audience for both is an emerging group of researchers at the University of Oregon formed to standardize efforts and tools across labs, so this document attempts to set our eyes a bit closer to the horizon, where "our" shifts somewhat interchangeably between referring to that group and systems neuroscience at large.*

# The State of Things

Suppose, for drama's sake, scientists, untethered by an ethics board and illuminated only by the lightning in their dark and stormy castle laboratory[^1], gave Idealized Science[^2] a body. Not quite the Fisher-Price-nice single body pushed by Big Mono-Corporealism, but a churning sentient gas erupting at all surfaces with pseudopod nebulae of empirical deviations, fissile and pendulous, abandoned like the legs of a retreating starfish in the face of overwhelming counterevidence. The scientists note it doesn't move forwards, or grow, per se, but nibbles at the radioactive holograms billowing from vents on the floor of reality to resolve the latent paradoxes of its body. Like a ballerina it arcs out of balance on one toe into impossible shapes so that in its momentum the bundle of its limbs can return to the placid rest of first position.

[^1]: Come on, say it out loud, give the syllables the sinister weight they deserve for castle labs, "lah-BORE-ah-tore-ee"

[^2]: Given their experience as zookeepers of Idealized Science, experiments with Actual Science have been indefinitely postponed.

At all scales, systems neuroscience is fragmented, and its movement as a unified body is mostly a trick of the light, where only the localized patches cohere. We work in technical islands that range from individual researchers, to labs, consortia, and at their largest a few well-funded organizations. Experimental instrumentation except for that at the polar extremes of technological complexity or simplicity is designed and built custom, locally, and on-demand. Software for performing experiments is a patchwork of libraries that satisfy some of the requirements of the experiment, sewn together by some uncommented script written years ago by a grad student who left the lab long-since. And O Lord Let Us Pray For The Data, born into this world without coherent form to speak of, indexable only by passively-encrypted notes in a paper lab notebook, dressed up for the analytical ball once before being mothballed in ignominy on some unlabeled external drive.

The fragmentation of systems neuroscience is a much greater than a sort of embarassed chuckle and "we'll paper over it with grad student labor" would suggest. Instead it represents

* A prodigious duplication and dead-weight loss of labor as each lab, and sometimes each person within each lab, will reinvent basic code, tools, and practices from scratch. Many PhD students will spend the first several years of their degree re-solving already-solved problems, chasing the tails of the wrong half-readable engineering whitepapers, in their 6th year finally discovering the technique that they actually needed all along. This isn't an educational or training model, it's effect of displacing the undone labor of unbuilt infrastructure on vulnerable graduate workers almost always paid poverty wages.
* A profoundly leaky knowledge acquisition system where entire PhDs worth of data can be lost and rendered useless when a student leaves a lab and no one remembers how to access the data or how it's formatted. 
* A B
* The need to constantly peer at the brain through the pinprickiest peephole of just the most recent data you or your lab have collected rather than being able to index across all relevant data from not only your lab, but all other labs that have measured the same phenomena
* The dearth of data transparency where it is still in the year of our lord 2021 rare for systems neuro papers to publish the full, raw data along with all the analysis code because the data *and* analysis code are both completely homebrew and often omitted just due to the labor of cleaning it or the embarassment of sharing it (not kidding).
* The inevitability of a replication crisis because it is often literally impossible to replicate an experiment that is done on a rig that was built one time, used entirely in-lab code, and was never documented
* An insular system where the inaccessibility of all the "meso" level knowledge that is beneath the level of publication but necessary to perform experiments, like "how to build this apparatus," "what kind of motor would work here," etc. is a force that favors established and well-funded labs who can rely on local knowledege and hiring engineers/etc. and excludes new, lesser-funded labs at non-ivy institutions.
