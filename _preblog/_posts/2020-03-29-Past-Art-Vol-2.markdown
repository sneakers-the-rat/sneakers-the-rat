There's a folder on my computer that is named `stupid_bullshit_projects` that continually fills up with the things that i make and never end up telling anyone about. It is never in a hurry to get filled up, and so I add to it in limps and startles. 

This last year was an especially good year for `stupid_bullshit_projects` because I was doing anything I could to distract myself from some heartbreak that was unbearable almost all of the time. Don't close the tab just yet, I'm mostly past it now, most of what's left is just reflecting.

I wanted to try to remember some of the things that I make, because maybe that would make them feel more real. Visual art came into my life very late, and I haven't quite shaken the feeling that I'm not invited. I've been led to believe that visual artists have a medium, and I don't really have the discipline to maintain one of those. Music has instruments and genres, but since synthesis and hip-hop have made a mess of those they never felt quite so intimidating.

Not really expecting anyone but me to get much joy out of them, but here are some things that I've made because I sorta had to. 


# With Music

Music is subtly but potently visual to me, and while I haven't quite gotten to the point that I can make video with my own music, I do love making videos to other people's music.

## Murmuration (2020.02.10)

The sun was just starting to come back to Eugene and I was putting some periods on some memories. Things were bulging and shifting and nothing really felt settled. There were some nice winter sunsets though.

This is a simple lil glitch, a pulsed p-frame duplication with an RGB channel shift. The blooming effect from 00:48 to 00:54 was what I was itching for. Most of the beauty comes from the source video, a starling murmuration.

Music: Laura Jean Anderson - thinkin bout you

## Thao & The Get Down Stay Down - A Man Alive (2020.01.27)

A) I love this album, and B) it was saying exactly what I was feeling at the time. These were three songs that I thought summed my bittersweet ass up relatively neatly *(you know I'm so easy to find, you won't come get your girl)*.

Technically very simple, rgb shift and a bunch of manual time warping & splicing.

## Guillotine (2019.12.02)
{:.no_toc}

Someone I like on Twitter posted some video using [visbeat](https://github.com/abedavis/visbeat) and so I made a bunch of deathgrips memes. this was my favorite one.

## Nick Hakim - Miss Chew (2019.11.02)

We had a party at my house and I had taken some MDMA that had some little extra kick in it that made my eyeballs spin out of my sockets. When I could focus my vision again I started synthesizing video to project over the dancefloor i mean our living room. A housemate of mine that loves horror movies had suggested we watch Nosferatu the night before so I was using that as some of the source material. Burned a bunch of music into a good place in my heart.

The next day I had a sentimental hangover, my heart was vacant, mostly I was full of missing. Another simple p-frame duplication with a little random hex noise thrown into the encoded video stream before it gets decoded.

## Tirzah - Affection (2019.10.22)

I was in an unexpected new depth in a hopeless argument with my heart, bargaining with my memories and promising to change, and working on a bunch of computer vision code. I started shooting video as a demo of the code for my collaborators, but got lost in its sort of numbing sparseness.

I can't really describe the process for this one -- the source video is some computer-vision glitch that I just kept pushing my thumb into until it looked right. Then I lost a few days layering and cutting the clips until it was done.

## Perlin Particles (2020.01.19)

A friend and mentor who is a recently-minted PI asked me to make her a lab website. This ended up being the central design element, but along the way I made a version just to play with. 

Particles on 2D perlin noise. I think this one does better without documentation, just play with the slideys and see.

## how to never get hired for any job pt 2. (2019.12.19)

My [about me](https://jon-e.net/about/) page is sorta an anti-about me page... while I was still getting used to having to be professional all the time it seemed super weird to me to have an entire page just describing yourself. So right now the page just indeciperably refers to my feelings about having people look at an "about me" page about me. I was trying to fix that and got lost along the way. The idea was to have my information passing by on these mountains and to make the user move their mouse to make certain regions lie flat long enough to read. I decided that sucks and that I should just make a real one, but inner me is holding up the timeline.

## Speeding Atlas (2019.11.15)

If you combine the [Stanford Open Policing Project](https://openpolicing.stanford.edu/data/) data with transportation department road use data and assume that speeding is roughly equally likely on all roads, you can make a map of the roads that you are more or less likely to get a speeding ticket on. This is a map for just Washington state because other states have less data available and beacause I realized what a huge waste of time this was.

Map made with [leaflet](https://rstudio.github.io/leaflet/) in R.

## instagram filters (2020.01.19)

I found out they let *just anyone* make instagram filters, and their platform is actually really lovely. I just made a few, not very good but i laughed a few times.

First a classic tinyface just to see how it works:

<video controls preload="none"  style="max-height: 70vh;">
    <source src="/blog/assets/images/artvol2/tinyface_2.mp4" type="video/mp4">
    Your browser doesn't support HTML5 video tag.
</video>

The I made a Mitt Romney face (and my housemate used it to watch Sex and the City):

<video controls preload="none"  style="max-height: 70vh;">
    <source src="/blog/assets/images/artvol2/mitt.mp4" type="video/mp4">
    Your browser doesn't support HTML5 video tag.
</video>

And then Hank. Took a lot to make the 3d model of the head and face work together, and to add a lil cherry on top you get a coupla catch phrases when u open your mouth.

## Autopotterotica (2020.01.01)

um.

Where to start with this one.

Fanfiction is, at least to me, one of the strangest but most beautiful human instincts. The raw diversity *and volume* of wish-fulfillment that happens within the bounds of fanfiction positively fucks up the elevation of my jaw. So I thought it might be interesting to have a neural net generate some. 

It turns out fanfiction.net is the largest natural language text corpus that I've ever been able to find by orders of magnitude -- 1.5T compressed text, hundreds or thousands of wikipedias. The scrape took \~7 weeks of 24/7 scraping.

I've never written fanfiction, but I did read a lot of experimental erotica at backyard poetry readings in college, and it quickly became clear what the neural net wanted to write. 

These stories are all 100% neural-net generated (finetuned GPT-2) text. They are about 50% fully-random initializations and 50% initializations with seed text, but it didn't take much. The only editing I do is cutting repetetive text, formatting into paragraphs, and minor fixes to punctuation -- I don't add anything or change its order. These are just a sample, I'm looking to finish the book during this great pause.

So, first, the scraping code for those for whom it would be useful, and then the smut for which I request you not put me in jail for.

## schillbot (2019.10.03)

To get under the paper-thin skin of our university's president while he was trying to balance the budget by taking medicine from graduate workers who make poverty wages, I made a twitter bot to mock him. The bot posted either a real quote or a neural-net generated quote and asked people to vote which one they thought it was.

I scraped all his often off-the-rails emails and writing from his website and trained a transformer model. This was before the proliferation of all these newfangled GPT-2 fine-tuned models, so it's a little rough, but these are some of my favorites:

Look! even the wonderful Janelle Shane helped out!

## red eyes on statues (2019.08.03)

A good friend sent me this:

![redeyes inspo](/blog/assets/images/artvol2/redeyes_inspo.png)

So I copied it. 

First I made some led-bombs by rigging them up to a 9V battery w/ a photodiode that turns the light off during the day to make them last longer.

<video controls preload="none" style="max-height: 70vh;">
  <source src="/blog/assets/images/artvol2/redeyes_prototype.mp4" type="video/mp4">
</video>

Then I attached them to a few statues around UO. I didn't really photograph or catch much video of this because I was basically in a fugue state from being deliriously heartbroken and it was maybe a little bit of vandalism.

# Design

## Autopilot (2019.10.17)

I released some [software](https://auto-pi-lot.com) and wrote a [paper](https://www.biorxiv.org/content/10.1101/807693v1) to describe it, and I spent a lot of time to make a beautiful document. Typography is another art I am working to get better at, and I don't really want to clutter up this post with a million page excerpts, but I am very proud of the way the figures are integrated with the text. 

I will include the documentation logo that I like a lot though.

## Union Propaganda

I don't contribute enough to my union, but the one thing that I do contribute is a bit of design. These were all made during our most recent round of bargaining, which revealed what an amoral disaster of an institution the University of Oregon is.

# stupid bullshit projects

And finally, a bunch of other assorted scraps and pieces presented more or less without comment.

![talking 2 people](/blog/assets/images/artvol2/the_great_bumblefuck.png)

My department does "bullshit research talks" at our retreats, where someone makes a ridiculous presentation and someone else has to present it. Having someone I look up to very much present this neural-net face swap was one of my finest moments.

This was a gift I made for a dear dear friend that I unfortunately didn't ever take a photo of the finished version. These panels stack together and have a few very fond memories in them. In this image:  She is the sun, and i am the moon. one of the first memories I have with her is drunkenly fucking up someone else's car radio (and it also fit iwth the scene), and nowadays I don't see her much in part because she is busy all over the world <3.

Another dear dear friend got married last summer, and her maid of honor asked us to bring a photo of us together to their wedding. Shitty photoshop, but shitty photoshops are sorta one of the things we have a deep and shared love for.
