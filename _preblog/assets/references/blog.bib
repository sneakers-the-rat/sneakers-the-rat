  abstract = {Distributed computer architectures labeled "peer-to-peer" are designed for the sharing of computer resources (content, storage, CPU cycles) by direct exchange, rather than requiring the intermediation or support of a centralized server or authority. Peer-to-peer architectures are characterized by their ability to adapt to failures and accommodate transient populations of nodes while maintaining acceptable connectivity and performance.Content distribution is an important peer-to-peer application on the Internet that has received considerable research attention. Content distribution applications typically allow personal computers to function in a coordinated manner as a distributed storage medium by contributing, searching, and obtaining digital content.In this survey, we propose a framework for analyzing peer-to-peer content distribution technologies. Our approach focuses on nonfunctional characteristics such as security, scalability, performance, fairness, and resource management potential, and examines the way in which these characteristics are reflected in---and affected by---the architectural design decisions adopted by current peer-to-peer systems.We study current peer-to-peer systems and infrastructure technologies in terms of their distributed object location and routing mechanisms, their approach to content replication, caching and migration, their support for encryption, access control, authentication and identity, anonymity, deniability, accountability and reputation, and their use of resource trading and management schemes.},

The graph dataset allows researchers to trace and follow the paths to understanding a body of work. By mapping the links between research datasets and related resources, the graph dataset improves both their discovery and visibility, while avoiding duplicate efforts in data creation. Ultimately, the linked datasets may spur novel ideas, facilitate reproducibility and re-use in new applications, stimulate combinatorial creativity, and foster collaborations across institutions.},

Within DCMI, however, the emphasis has been less on growing this small vocabulary than on clarifying how the DCMI vocabulary can “play well” with other, complementary vocabularies in a Semantic Web that recombines semantics from multiple sources for specialized purposes. This priority has led DCMI to examine models for referencing other vocabularies and to clarify the modeling bases for interoperability among heterogeneous systems.},

The article proposes a model of the science technician's role as broker in a serially interdependent occupational division of labor and then contextualizes the model by examining how technicians conceptualize and manage troubles that arise in the course of scientific procedures. The data suggest that technicians possess most of a lab's contextual knowledge and skill and that technicians, therefore, play a critical role in the production of scientific knowledge. Because contextual knowledge carries less status than formal knowledge, however, technicians experience status inconsistencies. The implications of such status inconsistencies for the transition to an increasingly technical workforce are discussed.},

This paper reports on a qualitative study of cyberinfrastructure development in the emerging field of metagenomics to illustrate some of the issues that can arise when cyberinfrastructures are faced with new scientific communities, practices, and research questions. New science inevitably brings new forms of data, new analysis tools, and the need to recontextualize existing data. Cyberinfrastructures must be prepared to adapt to the new scientific context. In this study, developers employed three strategies for addressing new scientific requirements: work-arounds, extensions, and from-scratch development. These strategies are informed by the tension between fitting the CI to the needs of a specific community and maintaining interoperability across systems.},

These data have been further integrated and augmented by a number of evolutionary and computational analyses. Together, our results advance the collective knowledge about human genome function in several major areas. First, our studies provide convincing evidence that the genome is pervasively transcribed, such that the majority of its bases can be found in primary transcripts, including non-protein-coding transcripts, and those that extensively overlap one another. Second, systematic examination of transcriptional regulation has yielded new understanding about transcription start sites, including their relationship to specific regulatory sequences and features of chromatin accessibility and histone modification. Third, a more sophisticated view of chromatin structure has emerged, including its inter-relationship with DNA replication and transcriptional regulation. Finally, integration of these new sources of information, in particular with respect to mammalian evolution based on inter- and intra-species sequence comparisons, has yielded new mechanistic and evolutionary insights concerning the functional landscape of the human genome. Together, these studies are defining a path for pursuit of a more comprehensive characterization of human genome function.},

  abstract = {SummaryThe insufficiency of terminological standards in neuroscience is increasingly recognized as a serious obstacle to interoperability. Adoption of a controlled vocabulary is a successful solution for small numbers of groups that work closely together but is impractical for large numbers of groups who represent diverse areas of research, index information by various legitimate nomenclatures, or publish in different languages. Interoperability among such disparate databases requires a translation mechanism, or “mediator,” to enable communication and data sharing among databases. Shared ontologies are essential components of a mediator. An ontology codifies the relations between terms of multiple nomenclatures and the concepts they represent. Neuroanatomy is central to neuroscience, and neuroanatomical terminology represents a core portion of the vocabulary of neuroscience. We have created in NeuroNames an ontology of 2500 neuroanatomical concepts referenced by 15,000 terms in seven languages. NeuroNames is the mediator for BrainInfo, a portal to neuroanatomy on the Web. We hope that a description of our experience in establishing interoperability between BrainInfo and other neuroscience Web sites may be useful to others engaged in the development of ontologies for neuroscience.},

  abstract = {This article presents Information Infrastructure Studies, a research area that takes up some core issues in digital information and organization research. Infrastructure Studies simultaneously addresses the technical, social, and organizational aspects of the development, usage, and maintenance of infrastructures in local communities as well as global arenas. While infrastructure is understood as a broad category referring to a variety of pervasive, enabling network resources such as railroad lines, plumbing and pipes, electrical power plants and wires, this article focuses on information infrastructure, such as computational services and help desks, or federating activities such as scientific data repositories and archives spanning the multiple disciplines needed to address such issues as climate warming and the biodiversity crisis. These are elements associated with the internet and, frequently today, associated with cyberinfrastructure or e-science endeavors. We argue that a theoretical understanding of infrastructure provides the context for needed dialogue between design, use, and sustainability of internet-based infrastructure services. This article outlines a research area and outlines overarching themes of Infrastructure Studies. Part one of the paper presents definitions for infrastructure and cyberinfrastructure, reviewing salient previous work. Part two portrays key ideas from infrastructure studies (knowledge work, social and political values, new forms of sociality, etc.). In closing, the character of the field today is considered.},

  abstract = {[Context] Significant changes are occurring in the scientific scenario. In particular, there is increasing collaboration among researchers, which has led to the increasing use of processing techniques and the need to share results and observations. Researchers usually need to compose experiments using available services to fulfill their requirements. However, finding and/or specifying scientific applications is not a trivial task and many scientists lack the computational knowledge necessary to compose their experiments. [Objective] Therefore, the objective of this work is to develop an infrastructure in which researchers can work with heterogeneous information, accessing scientific communities according to their interests. As a result, they can create new experiments with the help of compositions of semantic web services. [Methods] Considering the infrastructure model, a prototype was specified and evaluated in a real-world context. [Results] This evaluation found evidence for the feasibility of the use of this infrastructure in scientific scenarios. Therefore, this paper proposes a distributed platform where scientists can collaborate in order to specify an experiment and share its results, considering semantic information. This is in agreement with the ideas of “collaboratories”.},

  abstract = {CONTEXT: Most specialized users (scientists) that use bioinformatics applications do not have suitable training on software development. Software Product Line (SPL) employs the concept of reuse considering that it is defined as a set of systems that are developed from a common set of base artifacts. In some contexts, such as in bioinformatics applications, it is advantageous to develop a collection of related software products, using SPL approach. If software products are similar enough, there is the possibility of predicting their commonalities, differences and then reuse these common features to support the development of new applications in the bioinformatics area. OBJECTIVES: This paper presents the PL-Science approach which considers the context of SPL and ontology in order to assist scientists to define a scientific experiment, and to specify a workflow that encompasses bioinformatics applications of a given experiment. This paper also focuses on the use of ontologies to enable the use of Software Product Line in biological domains. METHOD: In the context of this paper, Scientific Software Product Line (SSPL) differs from the Software Product Line due to the fact that SSPL uses an abstract scientific workflow model. This workflow is defined according to a scientific domain and using this abstract workflow model the products (scientific applications/algorithms) are instantiated. RESULTS: Through the use of ontology as a knowledge representation model, we can provide domain restrictions as well as add semantic aspects in order to facilitate the selection and organization of bioinformatics workflows in a Scientific Software Product Line. The use of ontologies enables not only the expression of formal restrictions but also the inferences on these restrictions, considering that a scientific domain needs a formal specification. CONCLUSIONS: This paper presents the development of the PL-Science approach, encompassing a methodology and an infrastructure, and also presents an approach evaluation. This evaluation presents case studies in bioinformatics, which were conducted in two renowned research institutions in Brazil.},

In this work, we use real resting-state data and a total of 3 million random task group analyses to compute empirical familywise error rates for the fMRI software packages SPM, FSL, and AFNI, as well as a nonparametric permutation method. For a nominal familywise error rate of 5\%, the parametric statistical methods are shown to be conservative for voxelwise inference and invalid for clusterwise inference. Our results suggest that the principal cause of the invalid cluster inferences is spatial autocorrelation functions that do not follow the assumed Gaussian shape. By comparison, the nonparametric permutation test is found to produce nominal results for voxelwise as well as clusterwise inference. These findings speak to the need of validating the statistical methods being used in the field of neuroimaging.},

However, in designing such P2P file sharing protocols, there is a fundamental "tussle" between keeping peers, specially the more resourceful ones, in the system for as long as possible to help the system achieve better performance and allowing peers finish their download as quickly as possible. The current BT protocol represents only "one" possible implementation in this whole design spectrum. In this paper, we characterize the "complete" design space of BT-like protocols. We use fairness index to measure the fairness that incorporates the contribution peers make. We show that there is a wide range of design choices, ranging from optimizing the performance of file download, to optimizing the fairness measure. More importantly, we show that there is a simple and easily implementable design knob which can be used to choose a particular operating point in the design space. We then discuss different algorithms (centralized versus distributed) in realizing the design knob. We also carry out performance evaluation to quantify the merits and properties of the BT-like file sharing protocols.},

In light of the well-known expansion of information in the life sciences and the need for metadata to enhance its value, these repositories present a potentially valuable new resource for application developers. Here we characterize the current contents of two scientifically relevant metadata repositories created through social tagging. This investigation helps to establish how such socially constructed metadata might be used as it stands currently and to suggest ways that new social tagging systems might be designed that would yield better aggregate products.},

  abstract = {An approach to the coordinated sharing and interchange of computerized information is described emphasizing partial, controlled sharing among autonomous databases. Office information systems provide a particularly appropriate context for this type of information sharing and exchange. A federated database architecture is described in which a collection of independent database systems are united into a loosely coupled federation in order to share and exchange information. A federation consists of components (of which there may be any number) and a single federal dictionary. The components represent individual users, applications, workstations, or other components in an office information system. The federal dictionary is a specialized component that maintains the topology of the federation and oversees the entry of new components. Each component in the federation controls its interactions with other components by means of an export schema and an import schema. The export schema specifies the information that a component will share with other components, while the import schema specifies the nonlocal information that a component wishes to manipulate. The federated architecture provides mechanisms for sharing data, for sharing transactions (via message types) for combining information from several components, and for coordinating activities among autonomous components (via negotiation). A prototype implementation of the federated database mechanism is currently operational on an experimental basis.},

However, in such a database system, the set of information tuples in the universe is partitioned over many distributed nodes, for reasons including autonomy, scalability, availability, performance and security. It is not obvious how to enable generalpurpose discovery query support and collective collaborative functionality that operate on the distributed system as a whole, rather than on a given part of it. Further, it is not obvious how to allow for search results that are fresh, allowing dynamic content. It appears that a Peer-to-Peer (P2P) database network may be well suited to support dynamic distributed database search, for example for service discovery. In this paper, we devise the Unified Peer-to-Peer Database Framework (UPDF), which allows to express specific applications for arbitrary query languages (e.g. XQuery, SQL) and node topologies, and a wide range of data types, query response modes (e.g. Routed, Direct and Referral Response), neighbor selection policies, pipelining characteristics, timeout and other scope options.},

It has been demonstrated that communities that adopt SRE are greatly oversupplied, i.e., they have much higher seeder-to-leecher ratios than communities in which SRE is not employed. Most previous studies focus on showing the positive effect of SRE in achieving high downloading speed. However, in this paper we show through measurements that SRE also induces severe side-effects. Under SRE, users are forced to seed for excessively long times to maintain adequate sharing ratios to be able to start new downloads, though most of the time their seedings are not very productive (in terms of low upload speed). We also observe that many users who seed for very long times still have low sharing ratios. We find that this is due to the counter-intuitive phenomenon that long seeding times do not necessarily lead to large upload amounts. Based on these observations, we discuss possible strategies for users to gain sharing ratios efficiently, which help them to survive and thrive in private communities.},

By requiring members to maintain a minimum ratio between uploads and downloads, private communities effectively establish credit systems, and with them full-fledged economies. We report on a half-year-long measurement study of DIME -- a community for sharing live concert recordings -- that sheds light on the economic forces affecting users in such communities. A key observation is that while the download of files is priced only according to the size of the file, the rate of return for seeding new files is significantly greater than for seeding old files. We find via a natural experiment that users react to such differences in resale value by preferentially consuming older files during a 'free leech' period. We consider implications of these finding on a user's ability to earn credits and meet ratio enforcements, focusing in particular on the relationship between visitation frequency and wealth and on low bandwidth users. We then share details from an interview with DIME moderators, which highlights the goals of the community based on which we make suggestions for possible improvement.},

We use the concept of semantic proximity, which is essentially an abstraction/mapping between the domains of the two objects associated with the context of comparison. An explicit though partial context representation is proposed and the specificity relationship between contexts is defined.  The contexts are organized as a meet semi-lattice and associated operations like the greatest lower bound are defined.  The context of comparison and the type of abstractions used to relate the two objects form the basis of a semantic taxonomy.  At the semantic level, the intensional description of database objects provided by the context is expressed using description logics.  The terms used to construct the contexts are obtained from \{\textbackslash em domain-specific ontologies\}.Schema correspondences are used to store mappings from the semantic level to the data level and are associated with the respective contexts.  Inferences about database content at the federation level are modeled as changes in the context and the associated schema correspondences.  We try to reconcile the dual (schematic and semantic) perspectives by enumerating possible semantic similarities between objects having schema and data conflicts, and modeling schema correspondences as the projection of semantic proximity with respect to (wrt) context.},

  abstract = {{$<$}p{$>$}Progress in science requires standardized assays whose results can be readily shared, compared, and reproduced across laboratories. Reproducibility, however, has been a concern in neuroscience, particularly for measurements of mouse behavior. Here we show that a standardized task to probe decision-making in mice produces reproducible results across multiple laboratories. We designed a task for head-fixed mice that combines established assays of perceptual and value-based decision making, and we standardized training protocol and experimental hardware, software, and procedures. We trained 140 mice across seven laboratories in three countries, and we collected 5 million mouse choices into a publicly available database. Learning speed was variable across mice and laboratories, but once training was complete there were no significant differences in behavior across laboratories. Mice in different laboratories adopted similar reliance on visual stimuli, on past successes and failures, and on estimates of stimulus prior probability to guide their choices. These results reveal that a complex mouse behavior can be successfully reproduced across multiple laboratories. They establish a standard for reproducible rodent behavior, and provide an unprecedented dataset and open-access tools to study decision-making in mice. More generally, they indicate a path towards achieving reproducibility in neuroscience through collaborative open-science approaches.{$<$}/p{$>$}},

In this study we present BioTorrents, a website that allows open access sharing of scientific data and uses the popular BitTorrent peer-to-peer file sharing technology. BioTorrents allows files to be transferred rapidly due to the sharing of bandwidth across multiple institutions and provides more reliable file transfers due to the built-in error checking of the file sharing technology. BioTorrents contains multiple features, including keyword searching, category browsing, RSS feeds, torrent comments, and a discussion forum. BioTorrents is available at http://www.biotorrents.net.},

Data were generated using automated high-throughput procedures for in situ hybridization and data acquisition, and are publicly accessible online. Newly developed image-based informatics tools allow global genome-scale structural analysis and cross-correlation, as well as identification of regionally enriched genes. Unbiased fine-resolution analysis has identified highly specific cellular markers as well as extensive evidence of cellular heterogeneity not evident in classical neuroanatomical atlases. This highly standardized atlas provides an open, primary data resource for a wide variety of further studies concerning brain organization and function.},

  abstract = {Database systems were a solution to the problem of shared access to heterogeneous files created by multiple autonomous applications in a centralized environment. To make data usage easier, the files were replaced by a globally integrated database. To a large extent, the idea was successful, and many databases are now accessible through local and long-haul networks. Unavoidably, users now need shared access to multiple autonomous databases. The question is what the corresponding methodology should be. Should one reapply the database approach to create globally integrated distributed database systems or should a new approach be introduced? We argue for a new approach to solving such data management system problems, called multidatabase or federated systems. These systems make databases interoperable, that is, usable without a globally integrated schema. They preserve the autonomy of each database yet support shared access. Systems of this type will be of major importance in the future. This paper first discusses why this is the case. Then, it presents methodologies for their design. It further shows that major commerical relational database systems are evolving toward multidatabase systems. The paper discusses their capabilities and limitations, presents and discusses a set of prototypes, and, finally, presents some current research issues.},

Public and private BitTorrent communities are managed in different ways – for instance, some private communities enforce sharing ratios, have strict rules for content management, have a certain level of community oversight, and maintain a strong sense of exclusiveness. In this paper, we present the results of extensive measurements of more than half a million peers in five communities, ranging from highly popular and well-known public communities to elite private communities that can only be joined by invitation. We observe that the performance experienced by downloaders in the private communities is by far superior to the performance in the public communities, and we observe significant differences in connectability, seeder/leecher ratio, and seeding duration. Based on our results, we conjecture that when effective ratio enforcement mechanisms are in place, BitTorrent’s tit-for-tat mechanism is hardly influential anymore. Our multi-community, multi-swarm measurements are significantly broader and more extensive than any earlier measurement study on BitTorrent.},

In this work, we introduce IPLS, a fully decentralized federated learning framework that is partially based on the interplanetary file system (IPFS). By using IPLS and connecting into the corresponding private IPFS network, any party can initiate the training process of an ML model or join an ongoing training process that has already been started by another party. IPLS scales with the number of participants, is robust against intermittent connectivity and dynamic participant departures/arrivals, requires minimal resources, and guarantees that the accuracy of the trained model quickly converges to that of a centralized FL framework with an accuracy drop of less than one per thousand.},

The purpose of this paper is to aid in the understanding of a real P2P system that apparently has the right mechanisms to attract a large user community, to provide measurement data that may be useful in modeling P2P systems, and to identify design issues in such systems.},

  abstract = {A great deal of research on geographically distributed organizing focuses on communication among members; however, in the face of increasingly large, complex and interdependent infrastructure, scholars must also examine instances of technology-supported coordination that function by replacing rather than enhancing human communication among organizational members. Central to this are complex processes of delegation — in which organizational work and agency are passed back and forth across the shifting line between “social” and “technical” elements. Building on work in the sociology of science, this paper extends the concept of delegation and applies it to thorny questions around the work of sustaining organization over time. We explore two examples from the Open Science Grid (OSG), an initiative that distributes computational resources to geographically dispersed and otherwise loosely coordinated research teams. Our first case is one of successful delegation, as automated access to resources is extended to a new group of distributed scientists. We then turn our attention to a case where the process of delegation breaks down, revealing the usually invisible work needed to sustain “seamless” integration. As these cases show, delegation is complex, fragile, and central to the nature of contemporary organizing. Specifically, delegation: 1) reconfigures the organization of work; 2) transforms how outcomes are accomplished; 3) redistributes responsibility for organizational decision-making; and 4) shifts the visibility and invisibility of both actors and their work.},

Currently available tools strongly limit the complexity and reproducibility of experiments. Here we introduce Autopilot, a complete, open-source Python framework for behavioral neuroscience that distributes experiments over networked swarms of Raspberry Pis. Autopilot enables qualitatively greater experimental flexibility by allowing arbitrary numbers of hardware components to be combined in arbitrary experimental designs. Research is made reproducible by documenting all data and task design parameters in a human-readable and publishable format at the time of collection. Autopilot provides an order-of-magnitude performance improvement over existing tools while also being an order of magnitude less costly to implement. Autopilot’s flexible, scalable architecture allows neuroscientists to design the next generation of experiments to investigate the behaving brain.{$<$}/p{$>$}},

  abstract = {Peer-to-peer networking is a disruptive technology for large scale distributed app- cations that has recently gained wide interest due to the successes of peer-to-peer (P2P) content sharing, media streaming, and telephony applications. There are a large range of other applications under development or being proposed. The - derlying architectures share features such as decentralizaton, sharing of end system resources, autonomy, virtualization, and self-organization. These features constitute the P2P paradigm. This handbook broadly addresses a large cross-section of c- rent research and state-of-the-art reports on the nature of this paradigm from a large number of experts in the ?eld. Several trends in information and network technology such as increased perf- mance and deployment of broadband networking, wireless networking, and mobile devices are synergistic with and reinforcing the capabilities of the P2P paradigm. There is general expectation in the technical community that P2P networking will continue to be an important tool for networked applications and impact the evo- tion of the Internet. A large amount of research activity has resulted in a relatively short time, and a growing community of researchers has developed. The Handbook of Peer-to-Peer Networking is dedicated to discussions on P2P networks and their applications. This is a comprehensive book on P2P computing.},

  abstract = {Motivation: Data integration promises to be one of the main catalysts in enabling new insights to be drawn from the wealth of biological data available publicly. However, the heterogeneity of the different data sources, both at the syntactic and the semantic level, still poses significant challenges for achieving interoperability among biological databases.Results: We introduce an ontology-based federated approach for data integration. We applied this approach to three heterogeneous data stores that span different areas of biological knowledge: (i) Bgee, a gene expression relational database; (ii) Orthologous Matrix (OMA), a Hierarchical Data Format 5 orthology DS; and (iii) UniProtKB, a Resource Description Framework (RDF) store containing protein sequence and functional information. To enable federated queries across these sources, we first defined a new semantic model for gene expression called GenEx. We then show how the relational data in Bgee can be expressed as a virtual RDF graph, instantiating GenEx, through dedicated relational-to-RDF mappings. By applying these mappings, Bgee data are now accessible through a public SPARQL endpoint. Similarly, the materialized RDF data of OMA, expressed in terms of the Orthology ontology, is made available in a public SPARQL endpoint. We identified and formally described intersection points (i.e. virtual links) among the three data sources. These allow performing joint queries across the data stores. Finally, we lay the groundwork to enable nontechnical users to benefit from the integrated data, by providing a natural language template-based search interface.},

To this end, we crawl five of the most popular torrent-discovery sites over a ine-month period, identifying all of 4.6 million and 38,996 trackers that the sites reference. We also develop a high-performance tracker crawler, and over a narrow window of 12 hours, crawl essentially all of the public Ecosystem's trackers, obtaining peer lists for all referenced torrents. Complementing the torrent-discovery site and tracker crawling, we further crawl Azureus and Mainline DHTs for a random sample of torrents. Our resulting measurement data are more than an order of magnitude larger (in terms of number of torrents, trackers, or peers) than any earlier study. Using this extensive data set, we study in-depth the Ecosystem's torrent-discovery, tracker, peer, user behavior, and content landscapes. For peer statistics, the analysis is based on one typical snapshot obtained over 12 hours. We further analyze the fragility of the Ecosystem upon the removal of its most important tracker service.},
